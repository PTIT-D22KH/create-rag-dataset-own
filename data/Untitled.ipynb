Not to worry, this in-depth guide helps you with every role.<br />\\n<br />\\n- UPDATED FOR FM22 - <br />\\n- PART 4 OF THE PLAYER GUIDE SERIES -<br />\\n<br />\\nWhat role should you put your player in? Well that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a lot harder then one might imagine, just coming up with a tactic is tough. <br />\\n<br />\\nHere on FMScout not only do we have our <a href=\"f-fm22-tactics-index.html\">Tactics Index</a>, but guides to building a tactic and our <a href=\"c-tactical-development-workshop.html\">Tactic Development Workshop</a>. Check those out for more information.<br />\\n<br />\\n<h3>How do Roles Appear</h3>\\nFootball Manager makes it somewhat easy to understand how good a player is in available roles. When selecting a player role, a pop-up box appears with several shaded circles appearing next to roles. <br />\\n<br />\\nThe greener (more full) the circle is, the better the player is in that role and to the contrary - the more red (less full) the circle is, the worse they are. <br />\\n<br />\\nSo how can you adjust this to make a player better? Through training, development, tactics and playtime can a player learn a new role. <br />\\n<br />\\nOn FMScout we have the <a href=\"a-fm21-development-guide-and-training-schedules.html\">RDF Training Schedules &amp; Development guide</a> which can guide you in the growth of your players. <br />\\n<br />\\nAlso, through tools such as <a href=\"a-fm-genie-scout-22.html\">Genie Scout</a> and <a href=\"a-fm-scout-editor-2022.html\">FMSE</a> can you see exactly how good a player is in each selected role. <br />\\n<br />\\nOn top of that FMSE allows you to edit a player\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability to play in specific roles while Sports Interactive\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own In-Game Editor and <a href=\"a-fm22-official-pre-game-editor.html\">Database Editor</a> allow the same thing. <br />\\n<br />\\nBut as you sit at your screen, do you actually understand what each role is, what it does? What about the actions you call on your players to do in those roles such as Defend, Support, Attack or Automatic? <br />\\n<br />\\nGoing with one may seem like a good idea but it could completely destroy your tactic or make your player perform poorly. <br />\\n<br />\\nYou may think that a Wing-Back and Full-Back are not much different but it is completely farther from the truth. Do you understand the definition of what a Regista or a Segundo Volante is?<br />\\n<br />\\nThis guide breaks down each role, defining them accurately and how each sub-role affects a player\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability to play in the said role. Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s begin.<br />\\n<br />\\n<br />\\n<h3>Goalkeeper Roles</h3>\\n<br />\\n<h5>Goalkeeper</h5>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>The Goalkeeper role is having your keeper\\xe2\\x80\\x99s main focus on making saves from shots and collecting crosses. Essentially your keeper is the last line of defense and is the \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctraditional\\xe2\\x80\\x9d keeper. <strong>Despite being traditional, depending on their attributes they can still play key passes and have excellent distribution.</strong></blockquote>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:  <br />\\nDefend \\xe2\\x80\\x93 There is only one role and that is to stop goals going in. Simple and straightforward, defend the net.<br />\\n<br />\\n<h5>Sweeper Keeper</h5>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>This Goalkeeping role is a mixture between being a standard keeper and a Libero in essence. They will clean up balls from out wide or come out far; potentially even outside their box to play as an extra player or to initiate passes and start counter-attacks with direct through balls. <strong>A sweeper keeper does not necessarily mean a brilliant distributor \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it means that they can come out quickly and clean up balls which then puts them in an advantageous position to restart play, including long clearances.</strong></blockquote>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>: <br />\\n<ul>\\n<li>Defend \\xe2\\x80\\x93 The keeper will play a lot more cautiously but still try to start attacking or counter-attacking plays. They do not venture too far out of their box when in possession.</li>\\n<li>Support \\xe2\\x80\\x93 The keeper will stray just outside their penalty box and look to be more influential in starting plays or counter-attacking measures.</li>\\n<li>Attack \\xe2\\x80\\x93 A very \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbrave\\xe2\\x80\\x9d keeper who will travel far outside their area and be heavily involved with the ball at their feet.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<br />\\n<br />\\n<h3>Defending Roles</h3>\\n<br />\\n<h5>Wide Centre-Back <div class=\"label warning\">!NEW in FM22!</div></h5>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>The main job of this role is to stop the opposing attackers from playing and to clear the ball from danger when required. However, unlike standard central defenders - the <a href=\"a-fm22-new-player-role-wide-centre-back.html\">Wide Centre-Back</a> is encouraged to stay wide in position and support the midfield more like a full back.</blockquote>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br />\\n<ul>\\n<li>Defend - The player is more like a traditional centre-back in a back five. They will provide support in wide areas at times, but from deep. Less likely to overlap or underlap and more likely to provide a diagonal backwards passing option.</li>\\n<li>Support - In the supportive role, the wide centre-back is willing to make overlapping and underlapping runs to create 2 vs 1 situations. In this essence, they play more of a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfullback\\xe2\\x80\\x9d role in supporting the midfield.</li>\\n<li>Attack - With an attack duty, the player is willing to make regular overlapping and underlapping runs to create 2 vs 1 situations, and also has a higher tendency to dribble with the ball.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<br />\\n<h5>Central Defender</h5>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>Main job is to clear the ball from danger when needed to. In certain tactics this includes being good on the feet and maintaining possession.</blockquote>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br />\\n<ul>\\n<li>Defend \\xe2\\x80\\x93 The defender will be more of a \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctraditional\\xe2\\x80\\x9d defender with this role. They will be with their defensive partner(s) in working to break up attacks, preventing the ball from going into the box and marking opposition as a part of your tactic.</li>\\n<li>Stopper \\xe2\\x80\\x93 The stopper is the defender who will step up a bit more and close down players, marking earlier in the defensive plays.</li>\\n<li>Cover \\xe2\\x80\\x93 This role will make your defender play more as a sweeper, they will drop back a bit further then your defensive partner(s) and sweep up balls and mark overlapping players (has to be made specific with tactics).</li>\\n</ul>\\n<br />\\n<h5>Libero</h5>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>The libero literally means \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto sweep\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. They will stay behind the defensive line, looking to sweep up through balls, pick up extra forward players and make goal saving plays. This role has seen goalkeepers take this role as they play out more from the box. One brilliant positive of this role is the fact that this player allows an extra individual to be further back for taking care of defensive errors and taking possession of bad or loose balls.</blockquote>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>: <br />\\n<ul>\\n<li>Support \\xe2\\x80\\x93 With the Support duty, the libero will step into a midfield role when your team is in possession and look to start attacking play. Essentially a deep lying playmaker.</li>\\n<li>Attack \\xe2\\x80\\x93 With the Attack duty on, the libero almost has complete free reign as they will venture forward to provide a goal scoring threat either in the box but mostly from distance.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<br />\\n<h5>Ball Playing Defender</h5>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>This is the more common role seen in today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s football with defenders having to play out of the back and be excellent in passing. They will still have the main duty of being a defender and stop opposition attacks, but they are encouraged to play long balls or start moving forward with splitting balls and passes. This is really key for counter attacks.</blockquote>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br />\\n<ul>\\n<li>Defend \\xe2\\x80\\x93 The defender will not venture forward with this role, they will look to still perform defensive duties and play passes out from the back but their position will be in line with the defensive line or their partner.</li>\\n<li>Stopper \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Similar to the normal Central Defender role, they will close down players before getting into the box. This will be great for ball-players as if received or intercepted, they are a bit more advanced to pass out \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but can be caught out if not careful.</li>\\n<li>Cover \\xe2\\x80\\x93 This role is where the defender will drop deeper and still play balls but more across the back, to the wings or from behind the defensive line.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<br />\\n<h5>No-Nonsense Centre Back</h5>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>The \\xe2\\x80\\x9cold-school\\xe2\\x80\\x9d role of a defender with only one thing in mind \\xe2\\x80\\x93 clear it and stop attacks. The goal of the defender with this duty is to win the ball and get it cleared up the field and take no risks in doing so. Sometimes these clearances involve sending it to the stands rather than look for a pass, even if at moderate risk.</blockquote>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br />\\n<ul>\\n<li>Defend \\xe2\\x80\\x93 The same role as the Central Defender, staying in line with their defensive partner and break up attacks.</li>\\n<li>Stopper \\xe2\\x80\\x93 They will push ahead and look to stop the ball or close down players before getting into the penalty box.</li>\\n<li>Cover \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Will drop a touch deeper to sweep up any long balls.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<br />\\n<br />\\n<h3>Midfield Roles</h3>\\n<br />\\n<h5>Defensive Midfielder</h5>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>The main duties of this midfielder is to protect the defensive line when not in possession and support the midfield and advance players when in possession. They also have the key role of holding onto the ball and dictating the tempo or play to allow the defense and attack to reorganize themselves or get in position.</blockquote>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br />\\n<ul>\\n<li>Defend \\xe2\\x80\\x93 They will stay more defensive, similar to being an extra central defender but stay ahead of the defensive line and look to recycle possession efficiently.</li>\\n<li>Support \\xe2\\x80\\x93 With this role, the defensive midfielder will be more in line with the midfield, supporting attacking moves but staying a touch further back \\xe2\\x80\\x93 almost in a screening or safety role to be on guard of a counterattack.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<br />\\n<h5>Deep Lying Playmaker</h5>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>Operates in the spaces between the defense and midfield. They aim to start attacking plays by passing out to players or spaces further up the pitch. They are more creative but must also fulfill their defensive duties. Essentially a creative passer from deep.</blockquote>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br />\\n<ul>\\n<li>Defend \\xe2\\x80\\x93 This duty will make the player focus more on the defensive side of the game and support attacks but mostly just from passes. Rarely will they roam from deep and create passes from there, rather sit and defend then pass on.</li>\\n<li>Support \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Fulfilling their defensive duty but will bring the ball out of the defense to open more opportunities to pass or create an opportunity. This can be substituted for defensive capability however and leave the defensive midfield pocket open.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<br />\\n<h5>Ball Winning Midfielder</h5>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>The ball winning midfielder has the main role of closing-down the opposition and winning the ball back.</blockquote>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br />\\n<ul>\\n<li>Defend \\xe2\\x80\\x93 With this role, the player will look to win the ball back in front of the defensive line and quickly pass it on to another player.</li>\\n<li>Support \\xe2\\x80\\x93 The player will press higher, looking to win the ball higher up the pitch and be more supportive in counter attacking or retaining possession.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<br />\\n<h5>Anchor Man</h5>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>The main duty of this player is to sit between the defense and midfield. Their main job is to win the ball, intercept moves, runs and if recouping the ball \\xe2\\x80\\x93 pass it on to a more creative player. This player is more stagnant in positioning, they do not venture too far forward nor do they drop back as a Libero or as an extra Centre Back \\xe2\\x80\\x93 therefore they do not close down opposition frequently who are too far forward.</blockquote>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br />\\n<ul>\\n<li>Defend \\xe2\\x80\\x93 There is just one role for this position, and it makes sense considering their role. They are best suited in a structured system who have the straight-forward task of anchoring the defense, not being too creative nor dribble \\xe2\\x80\\x93 essentially as risk free as possible.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<br />\\n<h5>Half Back</h5>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>A mixture of a role which can be a bit confusing. The half-back at times will play as an extra center back to help recycle possession or be an extra passing option to continue moving the ball. They also play the role of being a defensive midfielder by supporting just above the defensive line and offer protection when out of possession.</blockquote>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>: <br />\\n<ul>\\n<li>Defend \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Again another duty with just a defensive role as they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t adventure forward and are on the pitch to aid the defensive first and foremost.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<br />\\n<h5>Regista</h5>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>Like a Deep Lying Playmaker but have way more freedom. Overall an aggressive, fast-paced midfielder who will look to press high, dictate the play from deep positions and offer creative outlets or transitional plays. What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s key is the unpredictability as they are given free rein on the pitch positionally \\xe2\\x80\\x93 however that can also backfire if not set up properly in your tactic.</blockquote>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br />\\n<ul>\\n<li>Support \\xe2\\x80\\x93 A perfect description of the Regista, an aggressive supporter from the deep midfield position. Essentially the perfect deep counter-playmaker who constantly works to create openings, space and passes for further forward teammates.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<br />\\n<h5>Roaming Playmaker</h5>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>This player will look to pick up the ball from a deep position and work it forward with runs, passing and creativity. They venture forward to outside the opposition penalty area as they look to create or shoot.</blockquote>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br />\\n<ul>\\n<li>Support \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Only one real role and that is the duty of a Roaming Playmaker. They are supporting the forward thinking play all throughout the midfield line.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<br />\\n<h5>Segundo Volante</h5>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>A direct translation for Segundo Volante is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSecond Steering Wheel\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. This player\\xe2\\x80\\x99s role is mainly a defensive role and a late support when going forward. They often run with the ball, arrive in an area with a late run and are the \\xe2\\x80\\x9csecond steering wheel\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in supporting the attacking play. Rather than being the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmain\\xe2\\x80\\x9d player, they are best partnered with an alternate more key or pivotal player such as an Anchor Man or Ball Winning Midfielder.</blockquote>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br />\\n<ul>\\n<li>Support \\xe2\\x80\\x93 The supportive role will make this player support the attack but picking and choosing the opportunities to arrive late in threatening areas. That success is based off their attributes.</li>\\n<li>Attack \\xe2\\x80\\x93 They are regularly arriving late in the penalty area or a real threat from distance as they attempt more shots on goal.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<br />\\n<h5>Central Midfielder</h5>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>The central midfielder is the link player and a hard worker. Rather than being more technically adept like a box-to-box midfielder, the central midfielder will perform various roles based on instruction, their abilities, and the needs of the team.</blockquote>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br />\\n<ul>\\n<li>Defend \\xe2\\x80\\x93 This role will make the player focus more on the defensive midfield actions; sitting deep, tracking midfield runners and passing lanes and controlling the temp and pace of your team.</li>\\n<li>Support \\xe2\\x80\\x93 A more balanced role between moving forward with the attack and supporting the defense when necessary. Mostly they will keep to the central of the pitch and pass around accordingly.</li>\\n<li>Attack \\xe2\\x80\\x93 This role will oblige your player to move forward into the final third and be a support for the forward players.</li>\\n<li>Automatic \\xe2\\x80\\x93 The midfielder will swap between the above three roles depending upon your team mentality.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<br />\\n<h5>Box-to-Box Midfielder</h5>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>The \\xe2\\x80\\x9cworkhorse\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of the midfield. Their attributes allow these players to contribute on all avenues of the pitch; attacking means their surging late into the box, have killer passes and provide a threat from distance. In defense it means protecting the back line and disturbing opposition midfield-to-forward play.</blockquote>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br />\\n<ul>\\n<li>Support \\xe2\\x80\\x93 There is only one role and that is the supportive role, which perfectly describes this player. The box-to-box midfielder is the support player in a squad. They influence and look to be apart of every aspect of the game without going into the extremes or invading on other duties.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<br />\\n<h5>Advanced Playmaker</h5>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>A quick transitional player is the Advanced Playmaker. They aim to turn defense into attack quickly and when not on the ball, will drop and find spaces just above the opposition midfield line and their defense.</blockquote>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br />\\n<ul>\\n<li>Support \\xe2\\x80\\x93 The supportive role is more of the traditional midfielder who will look to play passes and support forward players with runs, open play and passing.</li>\\n<li>Attack \\xe2\\x80\\x93 The attacking role initiates the Advanced Playmaker to focus on being a delayed run at the opposition defense and from a starting point which is deeper than a forward player. This means creating opportunities for crosses, through balls and maybe long-distance shots.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<br />\\n<h5>Mezzala</h5>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>The direct translation is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwing half or half wing(er)\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. So, this player is a central player that likes to drift wide but not too far wide as they are only a \\xe2\\x80\\x9chalf wing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x93 meaning they operate in the half-spaces. Simplistically in spaces from the center to the wing but not permanently on either extremity. They are positioned higher up in the midfield line and generally do not have as much defensive responsibility.</blockquote>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br />\\n<ul>\\n<li>Support \\xe2\\x80\\x93 The supportive role sees them work between being a midfield and the \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctraditional work\\xe2\\x80\\x9d along with their role and their contribution further up the pitch.</li>\\n<li>Attack \\xe2\\x80\\x93 This player generally leaves the midfield role and focuses more on moving slightly further up the pitch and working those half-spaces to contribute in the final third.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<br />\\n<h5>Carrilero</h5>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>A direct translation is \\xe2\\x80\\x9crailway man\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccon man\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which is quite fitting to the football description of this duty being defined as a midfielder who is a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshuttler\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. The job of this individual is to cover the lateral areas of the pitch and link the defense with the midfield. It is a deceptive role as they are a support piece of the midfield and link the lines of the midfield \\xe2\\x80\\x93 hence the term \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshuttler\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.</blockquote>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br />\\nSupport \\xe2\\x80\\x93 The only role that makes sense, a Carrilero strictly is a supportive player who covers the lines or \\xe2\\x80\\x9crailways\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the midfield position. They are deceptive in their play as they are not very noticeable and aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a vertical midfield player. They \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshuttle\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the ball between the two phases of play and support the team in that aspect.<br />\\n<br />\\n<br />\\n<h3>Flank Roles</h3>\\n<br />\\n<h5>Full Back</h5>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>The difference between the Full Back and the Wing Back is that the Full Back remains primarily a defensive player but will move forward when the team needs extra width. They are also more of a supportive role when going forward and not necessarily always in attack. Essentially defense is the priority then they will look forward while the Wing Back is opposite.</blockquote>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br />\\n<ul>\\n<li>Defend \\xe2\\x80\\x93 They will stay back with the defensive line; in possession they will play simple passes and not take much risk.</li>\\n<li>Support \\xe2\\x80\\x93 They will look to support the midfield line with width and when the opportunity rises, will provide crosses and long through balls from deep.</li>\\n<li>Attack \\xe2\\x80\\x93 The Full Back will start to diminish their defensive responsibilities and focus more in overlapping (or underlapping if tactics permit) the midfield and will look to provide crosses immediately into the box or killer balls across or in front of the opposition penalty area.</li>\\n<li>Automatic \\xe2\\x80\\x93 This role will set your Full Back to swap between the three above roles based on the team mentality.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<br />\\n<h5>Wing Back</h5>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>The Wing Back fulfills both the attacking duties of a winger and the defensive duties of a full back. They are seen up and down the wide positions on the pitch, looking to put in attacking play up the pitch, support the midfield and fall back into defense. Ones who play in this Wing Back role do not usually put defensive responsibilities first nor are actually too solid in defense at times.</blockquote>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br />\\n<ul>\\n<li>Defend \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Majority they will stay further back, a bit deeper but <strong>will still</strong> find space and look to support with passes and crossing in attack.</li>\\n<li>Support \\xe2\\x80\\x93 They will support attacking movement more with balls in and out of midfield, diagonal crosses and long through balls when needed.</li>\\n<li>Attack \\xe2\\x80\\x93 This role is the role where you see the Wing Back overlap with other attacking players and move in line with the attack to provide wide support.</li>\\n<li>Automatic \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Depending upon your team mentality, the roles will switch from the above three.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<br />\\n<h5>No-Nonsense Full Back</h5>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>Similar to the Non-Nonsense Center Back \\xe2\\x80\\x93 focusing predominantly on the defensive duties and rarely bombs forward in supportive or attacking play. Think of a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cflat back line\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for case in point. These players will be more disciplined and tactically adapt to whatever your responsibilities are for them defensively - minimizing offensive roles and attributes.</blockquote>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br />\\nDefend \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Self-explanatory, a defensive mindset and role for this position only.<br />\\n<br />\\n<h5>Complete Wing Back</h5>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>The complete wing back is competent in defensive but is essentially the attacking full-back. They will move forward to attack whenever possible and push into the opposition\\xe2\\x80\\x99s defensive third naturally.</blockquote>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br />\\n<ul>\\n<li>Support - Mostly be a supportive role and be smarter in play with their desire to move forward while keeping an eye on their defensive responsibilities.</li>\\n<li>Attack \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Abandon more their role to defend and stay just a bit further back in the final third in compensation for impacting the attacking play in a game.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<br />\\n<h5>Inverted Wing Back</h5>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>An Inverted Wing Back will line up as a standard wide defender, but they will move in field when in possession rather than stick wide to either create space or be an extra passing option. If teammates are not ahead of this player, they will push forward more and be supportive in the middle of the pitch.</blockquote>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br />\\n<ul>\\n<li>Defend \\xe2\\x80\\x93 They will sit deeper, focusing more on defensive duties depending on the formation and structure of your tactic.</li>\\n<li>Support \\xe2\\x80\\x93 With the supportive role they will look to cut inside to the middle of the field and then drift from that more central position to aid possession, passing options and support attacking movement.</li>\\n<li>Attack \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Cut in and move forward, supporting the attacking play either by cutting in or drifting out wide but mostly found in a more central area when up the pitch.</li>\\n<li>Automatic \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Will swap between the above three depending upon your team mentality.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<br />\\n<h5>Wide Midfielder</h5>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>The stereotypical player in a standard 4-4-2 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 performing both the defensive and attacking duties out wide. They are supportive players who perform work for all three avenues of the pitch: defense, midfield and attack.</blockquote>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br />\\n<ul>\\n<li>Defend \\xe2\\x80\\x93 This role instructs the player to sit back more as a cover for the defense and launch crosses from deep.</li>\\n<li>Support \\xe2\\x80\\x93 They will support the midfield play more, be more adventurous with through or diagonal passes and get balls into the box when appropriate. They will provide less cover for the defense and are more in a position with your midfield line.</li>\\n<li>Attack \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Moving up more and play quick crosses while they are in the final third of the pitch.</li>\\n<li>Automatic \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Their role will switch between the above roles according to your team mentality at setup and throughout the game.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<br />\\n<h5>Winger</h5>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>Little to say about this role \\xe2\\x80\\x93 simplistically its to stick wide towards the sideline, bomb forward either with the ball or beat the opposition and attack the byline.</blockquote>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br />\\n<ul>\\n<li>Support \\xe2\\x80\\x93 The supportive wall sets up the winger to cross early or launch long and through balls forward first and run to the byline to cross into the box.</li>\\n<li>Attack \\xe2\\x80\\x93 The attack duty will mean to attack the opposition defense specifically and then cross or even shoot if found in a position to do so. This role is more disruption then being a creative outlet via crossing.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<br />\\n<h5>Defensive Winger</h5>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>The duty of a Defensive Winger is to press opposition wide players, winning the ball up high the pitch and holding up play if necessary. In attacking play they can either drive to the byline or look to cut in slightly and play passes inwards or long diagonal/through balls.</blockquote>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br />\\n<ul>\\n<li>Defend \\xe2\\x80\\x93 The primary play with the defending role is to be a screen and insurance for the defensive players behind this player. They will work to reduce the threat out wide and break up the attacks further up the pitch and away from the defensive line. Keep in mind that they are not a defensive anchor however unless their attributes, personality, traits, your tactics and more guide them in that direction.</li>\\n<li>Support \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Less defensive responsibility and more the traditional wide player who will look to cross the ball early, run past the opposition or pass inwards to the midfield to recycle possession or progress forward.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<br />\\n<h5>Wide Playmaker</h5>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>The wide playmaker is a dual role. In possession, the player will be a source of creativity by drifting inside or out wide to find space and therefore a chance. Defensively (which is not common) their role is to provide cover for the defensive wide players such as the full back\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but they will not be astute in defensive capabilities, rather being an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cextra body\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or covering space in the defensive line.</blockquote>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br />\\n<ul>\\n<li>Support \\xe2\\x80\\x93 When the team is in possession, they will drift into a central midfield position or be just in line with the midfield and act as a creator on the ball.</li>\\n<li>Attack \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Being more advanced, they will sit in pockets of space between the midfield and attacking line in forward play. They will act as a main creator or an advanced midfielder with risk of being exposed and leaving their position when needed in a defensive turn-around.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<br />\\n<h5>Inverted Winger</h5>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>Often confused with an Inside Forward, the Inverted Winger has the goal of creating and opening space for onrushing wide players such as the full backs. Like the Inside Forward they will look to create and focus on their stronger foot which is opposite to the side of the pitch they are positioned on. Inverted Wingers tend to be more in between opposition lines of defense and midfield, focusing more on build up play rather than being a finishing force such as an Inside Forward.</blockquote>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br />\\n<ul>\\n<li>Support \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Supportive role means the wingers will cut into the middle which will open up space outside. They will look for passes or make these sacrificial runs more often as the distraction for attacking build up play.</li>\\n<li>Attack \\xe2\\x80\\x93 They runs in the attacking role will be more directed at the opposition defense, dragging along extra defensive players to make a killer pass, cross or potential shot while still running into the opposition final third.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<br />\\n<h5>Inside Forward</h5>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>More of a common sight in the modern game, the inside forward\\xe2\\x80\\x99s goal is to run from out wide towards the center of the opposition\\xe2\\x80\\x99s defense and penalty box. The reason for this is to make use of the player\\xe2\\x80\\x99s strongest foot which is the opposite of the side of the pitch he plays on. This movement allows for your teammates to run into space and commit to overlaps if instructed appropriately.</blockquote>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br />\\n<ul>\\n<li>Support \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Majority of the time they will cut in diagonally across behind the opposition defense or at them. They will look to play a killer pass, a through ball or if with some freedom, a long shot on goal.</li>\\n<li>Attack \\xe2\\x80\\x93 They will run at the defense as more of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cspearhead\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the attacking phase. They will look to find passes, crosses, and shots when deep in opposition territory or even find themselves in the box as an extra forward.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<br />\\n<h5>Wide Target Man</h5>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>Similar to being an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cupfront\\xe2\\x80\\x9d target man, they will be the target for transitional play, clearances and long balls from the back, but their location is that out wide rather than in middle pockets. The main reason for doing this is to exploit a weaker opposition wide player or find pockets of space in an opposition tactic. All other portions of the role are the same to that of a Target Man.</blockquote>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>: <br />\\n<ul>\\n<li>Support \\xe2\\x80\\x93 The support duty instructs this player to be more upbuilding in attacking play \\xe2\\x80\\x93 such as one touch play from headers or long balls to on rushing players, looking for passing lanes and opportunities towards the central players as they cause a nuisance out wide.</li>\\n<li>Attack \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Similar to the above but they will make their presence more known by forcing the opposition wide player(s) back with their attacking forward movement or overlapping/underlapping runs into the box once laying off the ball to a central player (your tactics permitting of course).</li>\\n</ul>\\n<br />\\n<h5>Raumdeuter</h5>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>The Raumdeuter literally means \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSpace Investigator\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. This means that the role of this player is to find pockets of space to operate in \\xe2\\x80\\x93 whether out wide or in the middle of the field of play. They use this role to be an extra option in forward play and hold onto possession in the final third \\xe2\\x80\\x93 then look for opportunities and little creative \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmoments\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to execute a lethal pass or shot.</blockquote>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br />\\n<ul>\\n<li>Attack \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Self explanatory as these players do not contribute to supportive or defensive play either on or off the ball. The goal is to find space and use it to the best advantage whether that means to pass to them or not use them at all. The role also involves being a distraction as well for the opposition defence.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<br />\\n<br />\\n<h3>Central Attack Roles</h3>\\n<br />\\n<h5>Attacking Midfielder</h5>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>Plays just in front of the central midfield role, therefore they are not found in deeper positions. They can either play just in front of the opposition\\xe2\\x80\\x99s midfield or just behind, they use their technical and mental abilities to create chances and screw with opposition defenders.</blockquote>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br />\\n<ul>\\n<li>Support \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Rather then trying to press forward in attacking play and get into the opposition box, they will sit back in pockets of space to link play or offer a long-distance attacking threat.</li>\\n<li>Attack \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Not only will they create chances but be an extra presence in the box to finish or play that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfinal pass\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in an attacking phase.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<br />\\n<h5>Advanced Playmaker</h5>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>This player will look to find space in-between the opposition\\xe2\\x80\\x99s midfield and defense. Their main role is be available for their teammates, whether that is to pass to, run into an open space or when out of possession find the pass or run to get onto the attack immediately.</blockquote>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br />\\n<ul>\\n<li>Support \\xe2\\x80\\x93 In the supporting role, the advanced playmaker will look to stay in between the two lines of the opposition and be the main support.</li>\\n<li>Attack \\xe2\\x80\\x93 This role gives the advanced playmaker the license to have a delayed or secondary run at the opposition which is to get the ball into the final third quickly and create an opportunity to pass the ball.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<br />\\n<h5>Trequartista</h5>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>Trequartista literally translates to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThree Quarters\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. That is where they will be found as these players are found between the furthest forward attacker and the midfield. They would have the combination role of not only finishing ability but creativity and the vision of a playmaker. They do almost no defensive play and spend their time off the ball finding and drifting into open space so that way when the ball is retained, a pass can pinpoint them and start the attacking play.</blockquote>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>: <br />\\n<ul>\\n<li>AMC Attack \\xe2\\x80\\x93 The attacking role best suits the Trequartista as it defines their role. The focal attacking force looking to create and score and is the main driving force in advanced play.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<br />\\n<h5>Enganche</h5>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>Enganche directly translated means \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHitch\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. That is exactly what this player does, similar to that of a Trequartista, they are the main link and prime creator in joining the midfield and attack. However, they do not move into large areas of space \\xe2\\x80\\x93 similar to that of a hitch or a link, it is a key focal point which does not move around much in terms of space \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it does one job and that is to link play and become a pivot to teammates around them.</blockquote>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br />\\n<ul>\\n<li>Support \\xe2\\x80\\x93 They are a supportive player in terms of attack, not necessarily supportive in defensive measures such as pressing or dropping deep. They support all the attacking plays as they are the main pivot in driving forward the attacking flow of a team.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<br />\\n<h5>Shadow Striker</h5>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>Best suited with a partner upfront, the Shadow Striker is a goal-scorer. They look to find themselves in goal scoring positions outside that of their partner striker and close down the opposition when out of possession.</blockquote>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br />\\n<ul>\\n<li>Attack \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Attacking is the only real role of the Shadow Striker, well they do press the opposition \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that is only from the front and they do not drop back as in other roles to support the play. They create on and from the front line.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<br />\\n<h5>Deep Lying Forward</h5>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>Often confused with a pressing forward or false nine \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the main idea is to be the link from the midfield or creative advanced midfield play to the attacking line. That means either dropping in space to create and pass, rotate and recycle possession or be the dribbling force to create space when going forward. Idealistically this role is best suited with another striker in your tactic as a partner.</blockquote>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>: <br />\\n<ul>\\n<li>Support \\xe2\\x80\\x93 The majority of this role will bring your player to focus on creating opportunities for teammates and aim to bring them into attacking play.</li>\\n<li>Attack \\xe2\\x80\\x93 This focus is not only to create but also bring themselves into good positions to finish attacking plays even when on the ball.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<br />\\n<h5>Advanced Forward</h5>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>This player has the role of being the main man or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfocal point\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of attacking moves \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that means both creating and scoring. This individual will also chase down balls from the midfield, look to gain possession back (nowhere near as much as a pressing forward), and create if found in the correct position to do so.</blockquote>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>: <br />\\n<ul>\\n<li>Attack \\xe2\\x80\\x93 The main idea is to attack and be the focal point, therefore there will be no real \\xe2\\x80\\x9csupportive\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdefensive\\xe2\\x80\\x9d roles for this duty.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<br />\\n<h5>Target Man</h5>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>They physical \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbig-man\\xe2\\x80\\x9d up front who challenges the opponent\\xe2\\x80\\x99s defense and is a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnuisance\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for defenders. Ideally the play is brought to them to open up more attacking play.</blockquote>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br />\\n<ul>\\n<li>Support \\xe2\\x80\\x93 The supportive target man will look to win the ball when launched up to them and play passes which will bring other attacking players into the transition.</li>\\n<li>Attack \\xe2\\x80\\x93 The attacking target man will look to make plays to open space for teammates to run into. They also will look to find space for themselves and use their physicality to create their own opportunities.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<br />\\n<h5>Poacher</h5>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>The main goal is to break past the defensive line and score goals. Build up play is not seen from this player as the creative build up is to end with them scoring. They will make runs and plays where their \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinstincts\\xe2\\x80\\x9d will create opportunities both inside and around the box.</blockquote>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br />\\n<ul>\\n<li>Attack \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Straight forward attacking player or the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstriker\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. The goal (excuse the pain) is to get the ball in the back of the net and they have that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cknack\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinstinct\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for finding goals.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<br />\\n<h5>Complete Forward</h5>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe all-round forward\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, they can shoot, hold up the ball, have that ability to be in the right place at the right time AND can pass the ball. This role is only suited to forwards who are technically adept to perform all those duties \\xe2\\x80\\x93 not necessarily high rating attributes \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but consistent in majority of their technical attributes.</blockquote>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br />\\n<ul>\\n<li>Support \\xe2\\x80\\x93 This role will make the player focus a bit more on creative play or being the forward catalyst in creating or starting the attack.</li>\\n<li>Attack \\xe2\\x80\\x93 This role makes the complete forward lead the line in attacking play, not only creating opportunities for others but mostly themselves.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<br />\\n<h5>Pressing Forward</h5>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFirst defense is your attack\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that is the role of the Pressing Forward. The main duty is to pressure the opposition players who have possession, press them down and make sure the opposition defense does not have too much time on the ball.</blockquote>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br />\\n<ul>\\n<li>Defend \\xe2\\x80\\x93 With this role, the player will look to bring other players into the game first and focus more on the defensive press rather than look to create their own chances.</li>\\n<li>Support \\xe2\\x80\\x93 The \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstandard\\xe2\\x80\\x9d role in playing as a Pressing Forward as the player will be riskier in trying to bring players into the game with more divisive passes and runs.</li>\\n<li>Attack \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Not only will they try and perform the defensive press, but this player will also play as more of an advanced forward \\xe2\\x80\\x93 meaning they will try and score rather than pass or bring in other players into the attack.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<br />\\n<h5>False Nine</h5>\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>A striker or center forward who drops deep into midfield.

       "- UPDATED FOR FM22 - <br/>\n",
       "- PART 4 OF THE PLAYER GUIDE SERIES -<br/>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "What role should you put your player in? Well that’s a lot harder then one might imagine, just coming up with a tactic is tough. <br/>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "Here on FMScout not only do we have our <a href=\"f-fm22-tactics-index.html\">Tactics Index</a>, but guides to building a tactic and our <a href=\"c-tactical-development-workshop.html\">Tactic Development Workshop</a>. Check those out for more information.<br/>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "<h3>How do Roles Appear</h3>\n",
       "Football Manager makes it somewhat easy to understand how good a player is in available roles. When selecting a player role, a pop-up box appears with several shaded circles appearing next to roles. <br/>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "The greener (more full) the circle is, the better the player is in that role and to the contrary - the more red (less full) the circle is, the worse they are. <br/>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "So how can you adjust this to make a player better? Through training, development, tactics and playtime can a player learn a new role. <br/>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "On FMScout we have the <a href=\"a-fm21-development-guide-and-training-schedules.html\">RDF Training Schedules &amp; Development guide</a> which can guide you in the growth of your players. <br/>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "Also, through tools such as <a href=\"a-fm-genie-scout-22.html\">Genie Scout</a> and <a href=\"a-fm-scout-editor-2022.html\">FMSE</a> can you see exactly how good a player is in each selected role. <br/>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "On top of that FMSE allows you to edit a player’s ability to play in specific roles while Sports Interactive’s own In-Game Editor and <a href=\"a-fm22-official-pre-game-editor.html\">Database Editor</a> allow the same thing. <br/>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "But as you sit at your screen, do you actually understand what each role is, what it does? What about the actions you call on your players to do in those roles such as Defend, Support, Attack or Automatic? <br/>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "Going with one may seem like a good idea but it could completely destroy your tactic or make your player perform poorly. <br/>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "You may think that a Wing-Back and Full-Back are not much different but it is completely farther from the truth. Do you understand the definition of what a Regista or a Segundo Volante is?<br/>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "This guide breaks down each role, defining them accurately and how each sub-role affects a player’s ability to play in the said role. Let’s begin.<br/>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "<h3>Goalkeeper Roles</h3>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "<h5>Goalkeeper</h5>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>The Goalkeeper role is having your keeper’s main focus on making saves from shots and collecting crosses. Essentially your keeper is the last line of defense and is the “traditional” keeper. <strong>Despite being traditional, depending on their attributes they can still play key passes and have excellent distribution.</strong></blockquote>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:  <br/>\n",
       "Defend – There is only one role and that is to stop goals going in. Simple and straightforward, defend the net.<br/>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "<h5>Sweeper Keeper</h5>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>This Goalkeeping role is a mixture between being a standard keeper and a Libero in essence. They will clean up balls from out wide or come out far; potentially even outside their box to play as an extra player or to initiate passes and start counter-attacks with direct through balls. <strong>A sweeper keeper does not necessarily mean a brilliant distributor – it means that they can come out quickly and clean up balls which then puts them in an advantageous position to restart play, including long clearances.</strong></blockquote>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>: <br/>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>Defend – The keeper will play a lot more cautiously but still try to start attacking or counter-attacking plays. They do not venture too far out of their box when in possession.</li>\n",
       "<li>Support – The keeper will stray just outside their penalty box and look to be more influential in starting plays or counter-attacking measures.</li>\n",
       "<li>Attack – A very “brave” keeper who will travel far outside their area and be heavily involved with the ball at their feet.</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "<h3>Defending Roles</h3>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "<h5>Wide Centre-Back <div class=\"label warning\">!NEW in FM22!</div></h5>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>The main job of this role is to stop the opposing attackers from playing and to clear the ball from danger when required. However, unlike standard central defenders - the <a href=\"a-fm22-new-player-role-wide-centre-back.html\">Wide Centre-Back</a> is encouraged to stay wide in position and support the midfield more like a full back.</blockquote>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br/>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>Defend - The player is more like a traditional centre-back in a back five. They will provide support in wide areas at times, but from deep. Less likely to overlap or underlap and more likely to provide a diagonal backwards passing option.</li>\n",
       "<li>Support - In the supportive role, the wide centre-back is willing to make overlapping and underlapping runs to create 2 vs 1 situations. In this essence, they play more of a “fullback” role in supporting the midfield.</li>\n",
       "<li>Attack - With an attack duty, the player is willing to make regular overlapping and underlapping runs to create 2 vs 1 situations, and also has a higher tendency to dribble with the ball.</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "<h5>Central Defender</h5>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>Main job is to clear the ball from danger when needed to. In certain tactics this includes being good on the feet and maintaining possession.</blockquote>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br/>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>Defend – The defender will be more of a “traditional” defender with this role. They will be with their defensive partner(s) in working to break up attacks, preventing the ball from going into the box and marking opposition as a part of your tactic.</li>\n",
       "<li>Stopper – The stopper is the defender who will step up a bit more and close down players, marking earlier in the defensive plays.</li>\n",
       "<li>Cover – This role will make your defender play more as a sweeper, they will drop back a bit further then your defensive partner(s) and sweep up balls and mark overlapping players (has to be made specific with tactics).</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "<h5>Libero</h5>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>The libero literally means “to sweep”. They will stay behind the defensive line, looking to sweep up through balls, pick up extra forward players and make goal saving plays. This role has seen goalkeepers take this role as they play out more from the box. One brilliant positive of this role is the fact that this player allows an extra individual to be further back for taking care of defensive errors and taking possession of bad or loose balls.</blockquote>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>: <br/>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>Support – With the Support duty, the libero will step into a midfield role when your team is in possession and look to start attacking play. Essentially a deep lying playmaker.</li>\n",
       "<li>Attack – With the Attack duty on, the libero almost has complete free reign as they will venture forward to provide a goal scoring threat either in the box but mostly from distance.</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "<h5>Ball Playing Defender</h5>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>This is the more common role seen in today’s football with defenders having to play out of the back and be excellent in passing. They will still have the main duty of being a defender and stop opposition attacks, but they are encouraged to play long balls or start moving forward with splitting balls and passes. This is really key for counter attacks.</blockquote>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br/>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>Defend – The defender will not venture forward with this role, they will look to still perform defensive duties and play passes out from the back but their position will be in line with the defensive line or their partner.</li>\n",
       "<li>Stopper – Similar to the normal Central Defender role, they will close down players before getting into the box. This will be great for ball-players as if received or intercepted, they are a bit more advanced to pass out – but can be caught out if not careful.</li>\n",
       "<li>Cover – This role is where the defender will drop deeper and still play balls but more across the back, to the wings or from behind the defensive line.</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "<h5>No-Nonsense Centre Back</h5>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>The “old-school” role of a defender with only one thing in mind – clear it and stop attacks. The goal of the defender with this duty is to win the ball and get it cleared up the field and take no risks in doing so. Sometimes these clearances involve sending it to the stands rather than look for a pass, even if at moderate risk.</blockquote>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br/>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>Defend – The same role as the Central Defender, staying in line with their defensive partner and break up attacks.</li>\n",
       "<li>Stopper – They will push ahead and look to stop the ball or close down players before getting into the penalty box.</li>\n",
       "<li>Cover – Will drop a touch deeper to sweep up any long balls.</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "<h3>Midfield Roles</h3>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "<h5>Defensive Midfielder</h5>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>The main duties of this midfielder is to protect the defensive line when not in possession and support the midfield and advance players when in possession. They also have the key role of holding onto the ball and dictating the tempo or play to allow the defense and attack to reorganize themselves or get in position.</blockquote>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br/>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>Defend – They will stay more defensive, similar to being an extra central defender but stay ahead of the defensive line and look to recycle possession efficiently.</li>\n",
       "<li>Support – With this role, the defensive midfielder will be more in line with the midfield, supporting attacking moves but staying a touch further back – almost in a screening or safety role to be on guard of a counterattack.</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "<h5>Deep Lying Playmaker</h5>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>Operates in the spaces between the defense and midfield. They aim to start attacking plays by passing out to players or spaces further up the pitch. They are more creative but must also fulfill their defensive duties. Essentially a creative passer from deep.</blockquote>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br/>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>Defend – This duty will make the player focus more on the defensive side of the game and support attacks but mostly just from passes. Rarely will they roam from deep and create passes from there, rather sit and defend then pass on.</li>\n",
       "<li>Support – Fulfilling their defensive duty but will bring the ball out of the defense to open more opportunities to pass or create an opportunity. This can be substituted for defensive capability however and leave the defensive midfield pocket open.</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "<h5>Ball Winning Midfielder</h5>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>The ball winning midfielder has the main role of closing-down the opposition and winning the ball back.</blockquote>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br/>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>Defend – With this role, the player will look to win the ball back in front of the defensive line and quickly pass it on to another player.</li>\n",
       "<li>Support – The player will press higher, looking to win the ball higher up the pitch and be more supportive in counter attacking or retaining possession.</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "<h5>Anchor Man</h5>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>The main duty of this player is to sit between the defense and midfield. Their main job is to win the ball, intercept moves, runs and if recouping the ball – pass it on to a more creative player. This player is more stagnant in positioning, they do not venture too far forward nor do they drop back as a Libero or as an extra Centre Back – therefore they do not close down opposition frequently who are too far forward.</blockquote>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br/>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>Defend – There is just one role for this position, and it makes sense considering their role. They are best suited in a structured system who have the straight-forward task of anchoring the defense, not being too creative nor dribble – essentially as risk free as possible.</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "<h5>Half Back</h5>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>A mixture of a role which can be a bit confusing. The half-back at times will play as an extra center back to help recycle possession or be an extra passing option to continue moving the ball. They also play the role of being a defensive midfielder by supporting just above the defensive line and offer protection when out of possession.</blockquote>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>: <br/>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>Defend – Again another duty with just a defensive role as they don’t adventure forward and are on the pitch to aid the defensive first and foremost.</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "<h5>Regista</h5>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>Like a Deep Lying Playmaker but have way more freedom. Overall an aggressive, fast-paced midfielder who will look to press high, dictate the play from deep positions and offer creative outlets or transitional plays. What’s key is the unpredictability as they are given free rein on the pitch positionally – however that can also backfire if not set up properly in your tactic.</blockquote>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br/>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>Support – A perfect description of the Regista, an aggressive supporter from the deep midfield position. Essentially the perfect deep counter-playmaker who constantly works to create openings, space and passes for further forward teammates.</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "<h5>Roaming Playmaker</h5>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>This player will look to pick up the ball from a deep position and work it forward with runs, passing and creativity. They venture forward to outside the opposition penalty area as they look to create or shoot.</blockquote>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br/>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>Support – Only one real role and that is the duty of a Roaming Playmaker. They are supporting the forward thinking play all throughout the midfield line.</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "<h5>Segundo Volante</h5>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>A direct translation for Segundo Volante is “Second Steering Wheel”. This player’s role is mainly a defensive role and a late support when going forward. They often run with the ball, arrive in an area with a late run and are the “second steering wheel” in supporting the attacking play. Rather than being the “main” player, they are best partnered with an alternate more key or pivotal player such as an Anchor Man or Ball Winning Midfielder.</blockquote>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br/>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>Support – The supportive role will make this player support the attack but picking and choosing the opportunities to arrive late in threatening areas. That success is based off their attributes.</li>\n",
       "<li>Attack – They are regularly arriving late in the penalty area or a real threat from distance as they attempt more shots on goal.</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "<h5>Central Midfielder</h5>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>The central midfielder is the link player and a hard worker. Rather than being more technically adept like a box-to-box midfielder, the central midfielder will perform various roles based on instruction, their abilities, and the needs of the team.</blockquote>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br/>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>Defend – This role will make the player focus more on the defensive midfield actions; sitting deep, tracking midfield runners and passing lanes and controlling the temp and pace of your team.</li>\n",
       "<li>Support – A more balanced role between moving forward with the attack and supporting the defense when necessary. Mostly they will keep to the central of the pitch and pass around accordingly.</li>\n",
       "<li>Attack – This role will oblige your player to move forward into the final third and be a support for the forward players.</li>\n",
       "<li>Automatic – The midfielder will swap between the above three roles depending upon your team mentality.</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "<h5>Box-to-Box Midfielder</h5>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>The “workhorse” of the midfield. Their attributes allow these players to contribute on all avenues of the pitch; attacking means their surging late into the box, have killer passes and provide a threat from distance. In defense it means protecting the back line and disturbing opposition midfield-to-forward play.</blockquote>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br/>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>Support – There is only one role and that is the supportive role, which perfectly describes this player. The box-to-box midfielder is the support player in a squad. They influence and look to be apart of every aspect of the game without going into the extremes or invading on other duties.</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "<h5>Advanced Playmaker</h5>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>A quick transitional player is the Advanced Playmaker. They aim to turn defense into attack quickly and when not on the ball, will drop and find spaces just above the opposition midfield line and their defense.</blockquote>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br/>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>Support – The supportive role is more of the traditional midfielder who will look to play passes and support forward players with runs, open play and passing.</li>\n",
       "<li>Attack – The attacking role initiates the Advanced Playmaker to focus on being a delayed run at the opposition defense and from a starting point which is deeper than a forward player. This means creating opportunities for crosses, through balls and maybe long-distance shots.</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "<h5>Mezzala</h5>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>The direct translation is “wing half or half wing(er)”. So, this player is a central player that likes to drift wide but not too far wide as they are only a “half wing” – meaning they operate in the half-spaces. Simplistically in spaces from the center to the wing but not permanently on either extremity. They are positioned higher up in the midfield line and generally do not have as much defensive responsibility.</blockquote>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br/>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>Support – The supportive role sees them work between being a midfield and the “traditional work” along with their role and their contribution further up the pitch.</li>\n",
       "<li>Attack – This player generally leaves the midfield role and focuses more on moving slightly further up the pitch and working those half-spaces to contribute in the final third.</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "<h5>Carrilero</h5>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>A direct translation is “railway man” or “con man” which is quite fitting to the football description of this duty being defined as a midfielder who is a “shuttler”. The job of this individual is to cover the lateral areas of the pitch and link the defense with the midfield. It is a deceptive role as they are a support piece of the midfield and link the lines of the midfield – hence the term “shuttler”.</blockquote>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br/>\n",
       "Support – The only role that makes sense, a Carrilero strictly is a supportive player who covers the lines or “railways” in the midfield position. They are deceptive in their play as they are not very noticeable and aren’t a vertical midfield player. They “shuttle” the ball between the two phases of play and support the team in that aspect.<br/>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "<h3>Flank Roles</h3>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "<h5>Full Back</h5>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>The difference between the Full Back and the Wing Back is that the Full Back remains primarily a defensive player but will move forward when the team needs extra width. They are also more of a supportive role when going forward and not necessarily always in attack. Essentially defense is the priority then they will look forward while the Wing Back is opposite.</blockquote>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br/>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>Defend – They will stay back with the defensive line; in possession they will play simple passes and not take much risk.</li>\n",
       "<li>Support – They will look to support the midfield line with width and when the opportunity rises, will provide crosses and long through balls from deep.</li>\n",
       "<li>Attack – The Full Back will start to diminish their defensive responsibilities and focus more in overlapping (or underlapping if tactics permit) the midfield and will look to provide crosses immediately into the box or killer balls across or in front of the opposition penalty area.</li>\n",
       "<li>Automatic – This role will set your Full Back to swap between the three above roles based on the team mentality.</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "<h5>Wing Back</h5>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>The Wing Back fulfills both the attacking duties of a winger and the defensive duties of a full back. They are seen up and down the wide positions on the pitch, looking to put in attacking play up the pitch, support the midfield and fall back into defense. Ones who play in this Wing Back role do not usually put defensive responsibilities first nor are actually too solid in defense at times.</blockquote>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br/>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>Defend – Majority they will stay further back, a bit deeper but <strong>will still</strong> find space and look to support with passes and crossing in attack.</li>\n",
       "<li>Support – They will support attacking movement more with balls in and out of midfield, diagonal crosses and long through balls when needed.</li>\n",
       "<li>Attack – This role is the role where you see the Wing Back overlap with other attacking players and move in line with the attack to provide wide support.</li>\n",
       "<li>Automatic – Depending upon your team mentality, the roles will switch from the above three.</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "<h5>No-Nonsense Full Back</h5>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>Similar to the Non-Nonsense Center Back – focusing predominantly on the defensive duties and rarely bombs forward in supportive or attacking play. Think of a “flat back line” for case in point. These players will be more disciplined and tactically adapt to whatever your responsibilities are for them defensively - minimizing offensive roles and attributes.</blockquote>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br/>\n",
       "Defend – Self-explanatory, a defensive mindset and role for this position only.<br/>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "<h5>Complete Wing Back</h5>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>The complete wing back is competent in defensive but is essentially the attacking full-back. They will move forward to attack whenever possible and push into the opposition’s defensive third naturally.</blockquote>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br/>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>Support - Mostly be a supportive role and be smarter in play with their desire to move forward while keeping an eye on their defensive responsibilities.</li>\n",
       "<li>Attack – Abandon more their role to defend and stay just a bit further back in the final third in compensation for impacting the attacking play in a game.</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "<h5>Inverted Wing Back</h5>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>An Inverted Wing Back will line up as a standard wide defender, but they will move in field when in possession rather than stick wide to either create space or be an extra passing option. If teammates are not ahead of this player, they will push forward more and be supportive in the middle of the pitch.</blockquote>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br/>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>Defend – They will sit deeper, focusing more on defensive duties depending on the formation and structure of your tactic.</li>\n",
       "<li>Support – With the supportive role they will look to cut inside to the middle of the field and then drift from that more central position to aid possession, passing options and support attacking movement.</li>\n",
       "<li>Attack – Cut in and move forward, supporting the attacking play either by cutting in or drifting out wide but mostly found in a more central area when up the pitch.</li>\n",
       "<li>Automatic – Will swap between the above three depending upon your team mentality.</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "<h5>Wide Midfielder</h5>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>The stereotypical player in a standard 4-4-2 – performing both the defensive and attacking duties out wide. They are supportive players who perform work for all three avenues of the pitch: defense, midfield and attack.</blockquote>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br/>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>Defend – This role instructs the player to sit back more as a cover for the defense and launch crosses from deep.</li>\n",
       "<li>Support – They will support the midfield play more, be more adventurous with through or diagonal passes and get balls into the box when appropriate. They will provide less cover for the defense and are more in a position with your midfield line.</li>\n",
       "<li>Attack – Moving up more and play quick crosses while they are in the final third of the pitch.</li>\n",
       "<li>Automatic – Their role will switch between the above roles according to your team mentality at setup and throughout the game.</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "<h5>Winger</h5>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>Little to say about this role – simplistically its to stick wide towards the sideline, bomb forward either with the ball or beat the opposition and attack the byline.</blockquote>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br/>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>Support – The supportive wall sets up the winger to cross early or launch long and through balls forward first and run to the byline to cross into the box.</li>\n",
       "<li>Attack – The attack duty will mean to attack the opposition defense specifically and then cross or even shoot if found in a position to do so. This role is more disruption then being a creative outlet via crossing.</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "<h5>Defensive Winger</h5>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>The duty of a Defensive Winger is to press opposition wide players, winning the ball up high the pitch and holding up play if necessary. In attacking play they can either drive to the byline or look to cut in slightly and play passes inwards or long diagonal/through balls.</blockquote>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br/>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>Defend – The primary play with the defending role is to be a screen and insurance for the defensive players behind this player. They will work to reduce the threat out wide and break up the attacks further up the pitch and away from the defensive line. Keep in mind that they are not a defensive anchor however unless their attributes, personality, traits, your tactics and more guide them in that direction.</li>\n",
       "<li>Support – Less defensive responsibility and more the traditional wide player who will look to cross the ball early, run past the opposition or pass inwards to the midfield to recycle possession or progress forward.</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "<h5>Wide Playmaker</h5>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>The wide playmaker is a dual role. In possession, the player will be a source of creativity by drifting inside or out wide to find space and therefore a chance. Defensively (which is not common) their role is to provide cover for the defensive wide players such as the full back’s – but they will not be astute in defensive capabilities, rather being an “extra body” or covering space in the defensive line.</blockquote>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br/>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>Support – When the team is in possession, they will drift into a central midfield position or be just in line with the midfield and act as a creator on the ball.</li>\n",
       "<li>Attack – Being more advanced, they will sit in pockets of space between the midfield and attacking line in forward play. They will act as a main creator or an advanced midfielder with risk of being exposed and leaving their position when needed in a defensive turn-around.</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "<h5>Inverted Winger</h5>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>Often confused with an Inside Forward, the Inverted Winger has the goal of creating and opening space for onrushing wide players such as the full backs. Like the Inside Forward they will look to create and focus on their stronger foot which is opposite to the side of the pitch they are positioned on. Inverted Wingers tend to be more in between opposition lines of defense and midfield, focusing more on build up play rather than being a finishing force such as an Inside Forward.</blockquote>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br/>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>Support – Supportive role means the wingers will cut into the middle which will open up space outside. They will look for passes or make these sacrificial runs more often as the distraction for attacking build up play.</li>\n",
       "<li>Attack – They runs in the attacking role will be more directed at the opposition defense, dragging along extra defensive players to make a killer pass, cross or potential shot while still running into the opposition final third.</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "<h5>Inside Forward</h5>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>More of a common sight in the modern game, the inside forward’s goal is to run from out wide towards the center of the opposition’s defense and penalty box. The reason for this is to make use of the player’s strongest foot which is the opposite of the side of the pitch he plays on. This movement allows for your teammates to run into space and commit to overlaps if instructed appropriately.</blockquote>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br/>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>Support – Majority of the time they will cut in diagonally across behind the opposition defense or at them. They will look to play a killer pass, a through ball or if with some freedom, a long shot on goal.</li>\n",
       "<li>Attack – They will run at the defense as more of the “spearhead” in the attacking phase. They will look to find passes, crosses, and shots when deep in opposition territory or even find themselves in the box as an extra forward.</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "<h5>Wide Target Man</h5>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>Similar to being an “upfront” target man, they will be the target for transitional play, clearances and long balls from the back, but their location is that out wide rather than in middle pockets. The main reason for doing this is to exploit a weaker opposition wide player or find pockets of space in an opposition tactic. All other portions of the role are the same to that of a Target Man.</blockquote>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>: <br/>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>Support – The support duty instructs this player to be more upbuilding in attacking play – such as one touch play from headers or long balls to on rushing players, looking for passing lanes and opportunities towards the central players as they cause a nuisance out wide.</li>\n",
       "<li>Attack – Similar to the above but they will make their presence more known by forcing the opposition wide player(s) back with their attacking forward movement or overlapping/underlapping runs into the box once laying off the ball to a central player (your tactics permitting of course).</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "<h5>Raumdeuter</h5>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>The Raumdeuter literally means “Space Investigator”. This means that the role of this player is to find pockets of space to operate in – whether out wide or in the middle of the field of play. They use this role to be an extra option in forward play and hold onto possession in the final third – then look for opportunities and little creative “moments” to execute a lethal pass or shot.</blockquote>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br/>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>Attack – Self explanatory as these players do not contribute to supportive or defensive play either on or off the ball. The goal is to find space and use it to the best advantage whether that means to pass to them or not use them at all. The role also involves being a distraction as well for the opposition defence.</li>\n",

       "<h3>Central Attack Roles</h3>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "<h5>Attacking Midfielder</h5>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>Plays just in front of the central midfield role, therefore they are not found in deeper positions. They can either play just in front of the opposition’s midfield or just behind, they use their technical and mental abilities to create chances and screw with opposition defenders.</blockquote>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br/>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>Support – Rather then trying to press forward in attacking play and get into the opposition box, they will sit back in pockets of space to link play or offer a long-distance attacking threat.</li>\n",
       "<li>Attack – Not only will they create chances but be an extra presence in the box to finish or play that “final pass” in an attacking phase.</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "<h5>Advanced Playmaker</h5>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>This player will look to find space in-between the opposition’s midfield and defense. Their main role is be available for their teammates, whether that is to pass to, run into an open space or when out of possession find the pass or run to get onto the attack immediately.</blockquote>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br/>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>Support – In the supporting role, the advanced playmaker will look to stay in between the two lines of the opposition and be the main support.</li>\n",
       "<li>Attack – This role gives the advanced playmaker the license to have a delayed or secondary run at the opposition which is to get the ball into the final third quickly and create an opportunity to pass the ball.</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "<h5>Trequartista</h5>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>Trequartista literally translates to “Three Quarters”. That is where they will be found as these players are found between the furthest forward attacker and the midfield. They would have the combination role of not only finishing ability but creativity and the vision of a playmaker. They do almost no defensive play and spend their time off the ball finding and drifting into open space so that way when the ball is retained, a pass can pinpoint them and start the attacking play.</blockquote>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>: <br/>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>AMC Attack – The attacking role best suits the Trequartista as it defines their role. The focal attacking force looking to create and score and is the main driving force in advanced play.</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "<h5>Enganche</h5>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>Enganche directly translated means “Hitch”. That is exactly what this player does, similar to that of a Trequartista, they are the main link and prime creator in joining the midfield and attack. However, they do not move into large areas of space – similar to that of a hitch or a link, it is a key focal point which does not move around much in terms of space – it does one job and that is to link play and become a pivot to teammates around them.</blockquote>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br/>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>Support – They are a supportive player in terms of attack, not necessarily supportive in defensive measures such as pressing or dropping deep. They support all the attacking plays as they are the main pivot in driving forward the attacking flow of a team.</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "<h5>Shadow Striker</h5>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>Best suited with a partner upfront, the Shadow Striker is a goal-scorer. They look to find themselves in goal scoring positions outside that of their partner striker and close down the opposition when out of possession.</blockquote>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br/>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>Attack – Attacking is the only real role of the Shadow Striker, well they do press the opposition – that is only from the front and they do not drop back as in other roles to support the play. They create on and from the front line.</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "<h5>Deep Lying Forward</h5>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>Often confused with a pressing forward or false nine – the main idea is to be the link from the midfield or creative advanced midfield play to the attacking line. That means either dropping in space to create and pass, rotate and recycle possession or be the dribbling force to create space when going forward. Idealistically this role is best suited with another striker in your tactic as a partner.</blockquote>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>: <br/>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>Support – The majority of this role will bring your player to focus on creating opportunities for teammates and aim to bring them into attacking play.</li>\n",
       "<li>Attack – This focus is not only to create but also bring themselves into good positions to finish attacking plays even when on the ball.</li>\n",

       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>This player has the role of being the main man or “focal point” of attacking moves – that means both creating and scoring. This individual will also chase down balls from the midfield, look to gain possession back (nowhere near as much as a pressing forward), and create if found in the correct position to do so.</blockquote>\n",

       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>Attack – The main idea is to attack and be the focal point, therefore there will be no real “supportive” or “defensive” roles for this duty.</li>\n",

       "<br/>\n",
       "<h5>Target Man</h5>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>They physical “big-man” up front who challenges the opponent’s defense and is a “nuisance” for defenders. Ideally the play is brought to them to open up more attacking play.</blockquote>\n",

       "<li>Support – The supportive target man will look to win the ball when launched up to them and play passes which will bring other attacking players into the transition.</li>\n",
       "<li>Attack – The attacking target man will look to make plays to open space for teammates to run into. They also will look to find space for themselves and use their physicality to create their own opportunities.</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "<h5>Poacher</h5>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>The main goal is to break past the defensive line and score goals. Build up play is not seen from this player as the creative build up is to end with them scoring. They will make runs and plays where their “instincts” will create opportunities both inside and around the box.</blockquote>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br/>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>Attack – Straight forward attacking player or the “striker”. The goal (excuse the pain) is to get the ball in the back of the net and they have that “knack” or “instinct” for finding goals.</li>\n",

This role is only suited to forwards who are technically adept to perform all those duties – not necessarily high rating attributes – but consistent in majority of their technical attributes.</blockquote>\n",

       "</ul>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "<h5>Pressing Forward</h5>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>“First defense is your attack” that is the role of the Pressing Forward. The main duty is to pressure the opposition players who have possession, press them down and make sure the opposition defense does not have too much time on the ball.</blockquote>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br/>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>Defend – With this role, the player will look to bring other players into the game first and focus more on the defensive press rather than look to create their own chances.</li>\n",
       "<li>Support – The “standard” role in playing as a Pressing Forward as the player will be riskier in trying to bring players into the game with more divisive passes and runs.</li>\n",
       "<li>Attack – Not only will they try and perform the defensive press, but this player will also play as more of an advanced forward – meaning they will try and score rather than pass or bring in other players into the attack.</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "<h5>False Nine</h5>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Definition</span>: <blockquote>A striker or center forward who drops deep into midfield. They do this to drag opposition defenders out of position, exploit space and create lanes for other attacking players.</blockquote>\n",
       "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Roles</span>:<br/>\n",
       "<ul>\n",

      "Role: Goalkeeper\n",
      "Definition: The Goalkeeper role is having your keeper’s main focus on making saves from shots and collecting crosses. Essentially your keeper is the last line of defense and is the “traditional” keeper. Despite being traditional, depending on their attributes they can still play key passes and have excellent distribution.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Sweeper Keeper\n",
      "Definition: This Goalkeeping role is a mixture between being a standard keeper and a Libero in essence. They will clean up balls from out wide or come out far; potentially even outside their box to play as an extra player or to initiate passes and start counter-attacks with direct through balls. A sweeper keeper does not necessarily mean a brilliant distributor – it means that they can come out quickly and clean up balls which then puts them in an advantageous position to restart play, including long clearances.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Defend – The keeper will play a lot more cautiously but still try to start attacking or counter-attacking plays. They do not venture too far out of their box when in possession.\n",
      " - Support – The keeper will stray just outside their penalty box and look to be more influential in starting plays or counter-attacking measures.\n",
      " - Attack – A very “brave” keeper who will travel far outside their area and be heavily involved with the ball at their feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Wide Centre-Back !NEW in FM22!\n",
      "Definition: The main job of this role is to stop the opposing attackers from playing and to clear the ball from danger when required. However, unlike standard central defenders - the Wide Centre-Back is encouraged to stay wide in position and support the midfield more like a full back.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Defend - The player is more like a traditional centre-back in a back five. They will provide support in wide areas at times, but from deep. Less likely to overlap or underlap and more likely to provide a diagonal backwards passing option.\n",
      " - Support - In the supportive role, the wide centre-back is willing to make overlapping and underlapping runs to create 2 vs 1 situations. In this essence, they play more of a “fullback” role in supporting the midfield.\n",
      " - Attack - With an attack duty, the player is willing to make regular overlapping and underlapping runs to create 2 vs 1 situations, and also has a higher tendency to dribble with the ball.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Central Defender\n",
      "Definition: Main job is to clear the ball from danger when needed to. In certain tactics this includes being good on the feet and maintaining possession.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Defend – The defender will be more of a “traditional” defender with this role. They will be with their defensive partner(s) in working to break up attacks, preventing the ball from going into the box and marking opposition as a part of your tactic.\n",
      " - Stopper – The stopper is the defender who will step up a bit more and close down players, marking earlier in the defensive plays.\n",
      " - Cover – This role will make your defender play more as a sweeper, they will drop back a bit further then your defensive partner(s) and sweep up balls and mark overlapping players (has to be made specific with tactics).\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Libero\n",
      "Definition: The libero literally means “to sweep”. They will stay behind the defensive line, looking to sweep up through balls, pick up extra forward players and make goal saving plays. This role has seen goalkeepers take this role as they play out more from the box. One brilliant positive of this role is the fact that this player allows an extra individual to be further back for taking care of defensive errors and taking possession of bad or loose balls.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Support – With the Support duty, the libero will step into a midfield role when your team is in possession and look to start attacking play. Essentially a deep lying playmaker.\n",
      " - Attack – With the Attack duty on, the libero almost has complete free reign as they will venture forward to provide a goal scoring threat either in the box but mostly from distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Ball Playing Defender\n",
      "Definition: This is the more common role seen in today’s football with defenders having to play out of the back and be excellent in passing. They will still have the main duty of being a defender and stop opposition attacks, but they are encouraged to play long balls or start moving forward with splitting balls and passes. This is really key for counter attacks.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Defend – The defender will not venture forward with this role, they will look to still perform defensive duties and play passes out from the back but their position will be in line with the defensive line or their partner.\n",
      " - Stopper – Similar to the normal Central Defender role, they will close down players before getting into the box. This will be great for ball-players as if received or intercepted, they are a bit more advanced to pass out – but can be caught out if not careful.\n",
      " - Cover – This role is where the defender will drop deeper and still play balls but more across the back, to the wings or from behind the defensive line.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: No-Nonsense Centre Back\n",
      "Definition: The “old-school” role of a defender with only one thing in mind – clear it and stop attacks. The goal of the defender with this duty is to win the ball and get it cleared up the field and take no risks in doing so. Sometimes these clearances involve sending it to the stands rather than look for a pass, even if at moderate risk.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Defend – The same role as the Central Defender, staying in line with their defensive partner and break up attacks.\n",
      " - Stopper – They will push ahead and look to stop the ball or close down players before getting into the penalty box.\n",
      " - Cover – Will drop a touch deeper to sweep up any long balls.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Defensive Midfielder\n",
      "Definition: The main duties of this midfielder is to protect the defensive line when not in possession and support the midfield and advance players when in possession. They also have the key role of holding onto the ball and dictating the tempo or play to allow the defense and attack to reorganize themselves or get in position.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Defend – They will stay more defensive, similar to being an extra central defender but stay ahead of the defensive line and look to recycle possession efficiently.\n",
      " - Support – With this role, the defensive midfielder will be more in line with the midfield, supporting attacking moves but staying a touch further back – almost in a screening or safety role to be on guard of a counterattack.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Deep Lying Playmaker\n",
      "Definition: Operates in the spaces between the defense and midfield. They aim to start attacking plays by passing out to players or spaces further up the pitch. They are more creative but must also fulfill their defensive duties. Essentially a creative passer from deep.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Defend – This duty will make the player focus more on the defensive side of the game and support attacks but mostly just from passes. Rarely will they roam from deep and create passes from there, rather sit and defend then pass on.\n",
      " - Support – Fulfilling their defensive duty but will bring the ball out of the defense to open more opportunities to pass or create an opportunity. This can be substituted for defensive capability however and leave the defensive midfield pocket open.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Ball Winning Midfielder\n",
      "Definition: The ball winning midfielder has the main role of closing-down the opposition and winning the ball back.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Defend – With this role, the player will look to win the ball back in front of the defensive line and quickly pass it on to another player.\n",
      " - Support – The player will press higher, looking to win the ball higher up the pitch and be more supportive in counter attacking or retaining possession.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Anchor Man\n",
      "Definition: The main duty of this player is to sit between the defense and midfield. Their main job is to win the ball, intercept moves, runs and if recouping the ball – pass it on to a more creative player. This player is more stagnant in positioning, they do not venture too far forward nor do they drop back as a Libero or as an extra Centre Back – therefore they do not close down opposition frequently who are too far forward.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Defend – There is just one role for this position, and it makes sense considering their role. They are best suited in a structured system who have the straight-forward task of anchoring the defense, not being too creative nor dribble – essentially as risk free as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Half Back\n",
      "Definition: A mixture of a role which can be a bit confusing. The half-back at times will play as an extra center back to help recycle possession or be an extra passing option to continue moving the ball. They also play the role of being a defensive midfielder by supporting just above the defensive line and offer protection when out of possession.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Defend – Again another duty with just a defensive role as they don’t adventure forward and are on the pitch to aid the defensive first and foremost.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Regista\n",
      "Definition: Like a Deep Lying Playmaker but have way more freedom. Overall an aggressive, fast-paced midfielder who will look to press high, dictate the play from deep positions and offer creative outlets or transitional plays. What’s key is the unpredictability as they are given free rein on the pitch positionally – however that can also backfire if not set up properly in your tactic.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Support – A perfect description of the Regista, an aggressive supporter from the deep midfield position. Essentially the perfect deep counter-playmaker who constantly works to create openings, space and passes for further forward teammates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Roaming Playmaker\n",
      "Definition: This player will look to pick up the ball from a deep position and work it forward with runs, passing and creativity. They venture forward to outside the opposition penalty area as they look to create or shoot.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Support – Only one real role and that is the duty of a Roaming Playmaker. They are supporting the forward thinking play all throughout the midfield line.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Segundo Volante\n",
      "Definition: A direct translation for Segundo Volante is “Second Steering Wheel”. This player’s role is mainly a defensive role and a late support when going forward. They often run with the ball, arrive in an area with a late run and are the “second steering wheel” in supporting the attacking play. Rather than being the “main” player, they are best partnered with an alternate more key or pivotal player such as an Anchor Man or Ball Winning Midfielder.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Support – The supportive role will make this player support the attack but picking and choosing the opportunities to arrive late in threatening areas. That success is based off their attributes.\n",
      " - Attack – They are regularly arriving late in the penalty area or a real threat from distance as they attempt more shots on goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Central Midfielder\n",
      "Definition: The central midfielder is the link player and a hard worker. Rather than being more technically adept like a box-to-box midfielder, the central midfielder will perform various roles based on instruction, their abilities, and the needs of the team.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Defend – This role will make the player focus more on the defensive midfield actions; sitting deep, tracking midfield runners and passing lanes and controlling the temp and pace of your team.\n",
      " - Support – A more balanced role between moving forward with the attack and supporting the defense when necessary. Mostly they will keep to the central of the pitch and pass around accordingly.\n",
      " - Attack – This role will oblige your player to move forward into the final third and be a support for the forward players.\n",
      " - Automatic – The midfielder will swap between the above three roles depending upon your team mentality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Box-to-Box Midfielder\n",
      "Definition: The “workhorse” of the midfield. Their attributes allow these players to contribute on all avenues of the pitch; attacking means their surging late into the box, have killer passes and provide a threat from distance. In defense it means protecting the back line and disturbing opposition midfield-to-forward play.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Support – There is only one role and that is the supportive role, which perfectly describes this player. The box-to-box midfielder is the support player in a squad. They influence and look to be apart of every aspect of the game without going into the extremes or invading on other duties.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Advanced Playmaker\n",
      "Definition: This player will look to find space in-between the opposition’s midfield and defense. Their main role is be available for their teammates, whether that is to pass to, run into an open space or when out of possession find the pass or run to get onto the attack immediately.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Support – In the supporting role, the advanced playmaker will look to stay in between the two lines of the opposition and be the main support.\n",
      " - Attack – This role gives the advanced playmaker the license to have a delayed or secondary run at the opposition which is to get the ball into the final third quickly and create an opportunity to pass the ball.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Mezzala\n",
      "Definition: The direct translation is “wing half or half wing(er)”. So, this player is a central player that likes to drift wide but not too far wide as they are only a “half wing” – meaning they operate in the half-spaces. Simplistically in spaces from the center to the wing but not permanently on either extremity. They are positioned higher up in the midfield line and generally do not have as much defensive responsibility.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Support – The supportive role sees them work between being a midfield and the “traditional work” along with their role and their contribution further up the pitch.\n",
      " - Attack – This player generally leaves the midfield role and focuses more on moving slightly further up the pitch and working those half-spaces to contribute in the final third.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Carrilero\n",
      "Definition: A direct translation is “railway man” or “con man” which is quite fitting to the football description of this duty being defined as a midfielder who is a “shuttler”. The job of this individual is to cover the lateral areas of the pitch and link the defense with the midfield. It is a deceptive role as they are a support piece of the midfield and link the lines of the midfield – hence the term “shuttler”.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Full Back\n",
      "Definition: The difference between the Full Back and the Wing Back is that the Full Back remains primarily a defensive player but will move forward when the team needs extra width. They are also more of a supportive role when going forward and not necessarily always in attack. Essentially defense is the priority then they will look forward while the Wing Back is opposite.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Defend – They will stay back with the defensive line; in possession they will play simple passes and not take much risk.\n",
      " - Support – They will look to support the midfield line with width and when the opportunity rises, will provide crosses and long through balls from deep.\n",
      " - Attack – The Full Back will start to diminish their defensive responsibilities and focus more in overlapping (or underlapping if tactics permit) the midfield and will look to provide crosses immediately into the box or killer balls across or in front of the opposition penalty area.\n",
      " - Automatic – This role will set your Full Back to swap between the three above roles based on the team mentality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Wing Back\n",
      "Definition: The Wing Back fulfills both the attacking duties of a winger and the defensive duties of a full back. They are seen up and down the wide positions on the pitch, looking to put in attacking play up the pitch, support the midfield and fall back into defense. Ones who play in this Wing Back role do not usually put defensive responsibilities first nor are actually too solid in defense at times.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Defend – Majority they will stay further back, a bit deeper but will still find space and look to support with passes and crossing in attack.\n",
      " - Support – They will support attacking movement more with balls in and out of midfield, diagonal crosses and long through balls when needed.\n",
      " - Attack – This role is the role where you see the Wing Back overlap with other attacking players and move in line with the attack to provide wide support.\n",
      " - Automatic – Depending upon your team mentality, the roles will switch from the above three.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: No-Nonsense Full Back\n",
      "Definition: Similar to the Non-Nonsense Center Back – focusing predominantly on the defensive duties and rarely bombs forward in supportive or attacking play. Think of a “flat back line” for case in point. These players will be more disciplined and tactically adapt to whatever your responsibilities are for them defensively - minimizing offensive roles and attributes.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Complete Wing Back\n",
      "Definition: The complete wing back is competent in defensive but is essentially the attacking full-back. They will move forward to attack whenever possible and push into the opposition’s defensive third naturally.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Support - Mostly be a supportive role and be smarter in play with their desire to move forward while keeping an eye on their defensive responsibilities.\n",
      " - Attack – Abandon more their role to defend and stay just a bit further back in the final third in compensation for impacting the attacking play in a game.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Inverted Wing Back\n",
      "Definition: An Inverted Wing Back will line up as a standard wide defender, but they will move in field when in possession rather than stick wide to either create space or be an extra passing option. If teammates are not ahead of this player, they will push forward more and be supportive in the middle of the pitch.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Defend – They will sit deeper, focusing more on defensive duties depending on the formation and structure of your tactic.\n",
      " - Support – With the supportive role they will look to cut inside to the middle of the field and then drift from that more central position to aid possession, passing options and support attacking movement.\n",
      " - Attack – Cut in and move forward, supporting the attacking play either by cutting in or drifting out wide but mostly found in a more central area when up the pitch.\n",
      " - Automatic – Will swap between the above three depending upon your team mentality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Wide Midfielder\n",
      "Definition: The stereotypical player in a standard 4-4-2 – performing both the defensive and attacking duties out wide. They are supportive players who perform work for all three avenues of the pitch: defense, midfield and attack.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Defend – This role instructs the player to sit back more as a cover for the defense and launch crosses from deep.\n",
      " - Support – They will support the midfield play more, be more adventurous with through or diagonal passes and get balls into the box when appropriate. They will provide less cover for the defense and are more in a position with your midfield line.\n",
      " - Attack – Moving up more and play quick crosses while they are in the final third of the pitch.\n",
      " - Automatic – Their role will switch between the above roles according to your team mentality at setup and throughout the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Winger\n",
      "Definition: Little to say about this role – simplistically its to stick wide towards the sideline, bomb forward either with the ball or beat the opposition and attack the byline.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Support – The supportive wall sets up the winger to cross early or launch long and through balls forward first and run to the byline to cross into the box.\n",
      " - Attack – The attack duty will mean to attack the opposition defense specifically and then cross or even shoot if found in a position to do so. This role is more disruption then being a creative outlet via crossing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Defensive Winger\n",
      "Definition: The duty of a Defensive Winger is to press opposition wide players, winning the ball up high the pitch and holding up play if necessary. In attacking play they can either drive to the byline or look to cut in slightly and play passes inwards or long diagonal/through balls.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Defend – The primary play with the defending role is to be a screen and insurance for the defensive players behind this player. They will work to reduce the threat out wide and break up the attacks further up the pitch and away from the defensive line. Keep in mind that they are not a defensive anchor however unless their attributes, personality, traits, your tactics and more guide them in that direction.\n",
      " - Support – Less defensive responsibility and more the traditional wide player who will look to cross the ball early, run past the opposition or pass inwards to the midfield to recycle possession or progress forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Wide Playmaker\n",
      "Definition: The wide playmaker is a dual role. In possession, the player will be a source of creativity by drifting inside or out wide to find space and therefore a chance. Defensively (which is not common) their role is to provide cover for the defensive wide players such as the full back’s – but they will not be astute in defensive capabilities, rather being an “extra body” or covering space in the defensive line.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Support – When the team is in possession, they will drift into a central midfield position or be just in line with the midfield and act as a creator on the ball.\n",
      " - Attack – Being more advanced, they will sit in pockets of space between the midfield and attacking line in forward play. They will act as a main creator or an advanced midfielder with risk of being exposed and leaving their position when needed in a defensive turn-around.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Inverted Winger\n",
      "Definition: Often confused with an Inside Forward, the Inverted Winger has the goal of creating and opening space for onrushing wide players such as the full backs. Like the Inside Forward they will look to create and focus on their stronger foot which is opposite to the side of the pitch they are positioned on. Inverted Wingers tend to be more in between opposition lines of defense and midfield, focusing more on build up play rather than being a finishing force such as an Inside Forward.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Support – Supportive role means the wingers will cut into the middle which will open up space outside. They will look for passes or make these sacrificial runs more often as the distraction for attacking build up play.\n",
      " - Attack – They runs in the attacking role will be more directed at the opposition defense, dragging along extra defensive players to make a killer pass, cross or potential shot while still running into the opposition final third.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Inside Forward\n",
      "Definition: More of a common sight in the modern game, the inside forward’s goal is to run from out wide towards the center of the opposition’s defense and penalty box. The reason for this is to make use of the player’s strongest foot which is the opposite of the side of the pitch he plays on. This movement allows for your teammates to run into space and commit to overlaps if instructed appropriately.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Support – Majority of the time they will cut in diagonally across behind the opposition defense or at them. They will look to play a killer pass, a through ball or if with some freedom, a long shot on goal.\n",
      " - Attack – They will run at the defense as more of the “spearhead” in the attacking phase. They will look to find passes, crosses, and shots when deep in opposition territory or even find themselves in the box as an extra forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Wide Target Man\n",
      "Definition: Similar to being an “upfront” target man, they will be the target for transitional play, clearances and long balls from the back, but their location is that out wide rather than in middle pockets. The main reason for doing this is to exploit a weaker opposition wide player or find pockets of space in an opposition tactic. All other portions of the role are the same to that of a Target Man.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Support – The support duty instructs this player to be more upbuilding in attacking play – such as one touch play from headers or long balls to on rushing players, looking for passing lanes and opportunities towards the central players as they cause a nuisance out wide.\n",
      " - Attack – Similar to the above but they will make their presence more known by forcing the opposition wide player(s) back with their attacking forward movement or overlapping/underlapping runs into the box once laying off the ball to a central player (your tactics permitting of course).\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Raumdeuter\n",
      "Definition: The Raumdeuter literally means “Space Investigator”. This means that the role of this player is to find pockets of space to operate in – whether out wide or in the middle of the field of play. They use this role to be an extra option in forward play and hold onto possession in the final third – then look for opportunities and little creative “moments” to execute a lethal pass or shot.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Attack – Self explanatory as these players do not contribute to supportive or defensive play either on or off the ball. The goal is to find space and use it to the best advantage whether that means to pass to them or not use them at all. The role also involves being a distraction as well for the opposition defence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Attacking Midfielder\n",
      "Definition: Plays just in front of the central midfield role, therefore they are not found in deeper positions. They can either play just in front of the opposition’s midfield or just behind, they use their technical and mental abilities to create chances and screw with opposition defenders.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Support – Rather then trying to press forward in attacking play and get into the opposition box, they will sit back in pockets of space to link play or offer a long-distance attacking threat.\n",
      " - Attack – Not only will they create chances but be an extra presence in the box to finish or play that “final pass” in an attacking phase.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Trequartista\n",
      "Definition: Trequartista literally translates to “Three Quarters”. That is where they will be found as these players are found between the furthest forward attacker and the midfield. They would have the combination role of not only finishing ability but creativity and the vision of a playmaker. They do almost no defensive play and spend their time off the ball finding and drifting into open space so that way when the ball is retained, a pass can pinpoint them and start the attacking play.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - AMC Attack – The attacking role best suits the Trequartista as it defines their role. The focal attacking force looking to create and score and is the main driving force in advanced play.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Enganche\n",
      "Definition: Enganche directly translated means “Hitch”. That is exactly what this player does, similar to that of a Trequartista, they are the main link and prime creator in joining the midfield and attack. However, they do not move into large areas of space – similar to that of a hitch or a link, it is a key focal point which does not move around much in terms of space – it does one job and that is to link play and become a pivot to teammates around them.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Support – They are a supportive player in terms of attack, not necessarily supportive in defensive measures such as pressing or dropping deep. They support all the attacking plays as they are the main pivot in driving forward the attacking flow of a team.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Shadow Striker\n",
      "Definition: Best suited with a partner upfront, the Shadow Striker is a goal-scorer. They look to find themselves in goal scoring positions outside that of their partner striker and close down the opposition when out of possession.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Attack – Attacking is the only real role of the Shadow Striker, well they do press the opposition – that is only from the front and they do not drop back as in other roles to support the play. They create on and from the front line.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Deep Lying Forward\n",
      "Definition: Often confused with a pressing forward or false nine – the main idea is to be the link from the midfield or creative advanced midfield play to the attacking line. That means either dropping in space to create and pass, rotate and recycle possession or be the dribbling force to create space when going forward. Idealistically this role is best suited with another striker in your tactic as a partner.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Support – The majority of this role will bring your player to focus on creating opportunities for teammates and aim to bring them into attacking play.\n",
      " - Attack – This focus is not only to create but also bring themselves into good positions to finish attacking plays even when on the ball.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Advanced Forward\n",
      "Definition: This player has the role of being the main man or “focal point” of attacking moves – that means both creating and scoring. This individual will also chase down balls from the midfield, look to gain possession back (nowhere near as much as a pressing forward), and create if found in the correct position to do so.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Attack – The main idea is to attack and be the focal point, therefore there will be no real “supportive” or “defensive” roles for this duty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Target Man\n",
      "Definition: They physical “big-man” up front who challenges the opponent’s defense and is a “nuisance” for defenders. Ideally the play is brought to them to open up more attacking play.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Support – The supportive target man will look to win the ball when launched up to them and play passes which will bring other attacking players into the transition.\n",
      " - Attack – The attacking target man will look to make plays to open space for teammates to run into. They also will look to find space for themselves and use their physicality to create their own opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Poacher\n",
      "Definition: The main goal is to break past the defensive line and score goals. Build up play is not seen from this player as the creative build up is to end with them scoring. They will make runs and plays where their “instincts” will create opportunities both inside and around the box.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Attack – Straight forward attacking player or the “striker”. The goal (excuse the pain) is to get the ball in the back of the net and they have that “knack” or “instinct” for finding goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Complete Forward\n",
      "Definition: “The all-round forward”, they can shoot, hold up the ball, have that ability to be in the right place at the right time AND can pass the ball. This role is only suited to forwards who are technically adept to perform all those duties – not necessarily high rating attributes – but consistent in majority of their technical attributes.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Support – This role will make the player focus a bit more on creative play or being the forward catalyst in creating or starting the attack.\n",
      " - Attack – This role makes the complete forward lead the line in attacking play, not only creating opportunities for others but mostly themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Pressing Forward\n",
      "Definition: “First defense is your attack” that is the role of the Pressing Forward. The main duty is to pressure the opposition players who have possession, press them down and make sure the opposition defense does not have too much time on the ball.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Defend – With this role, the player will look to bring other players into the game first and focus more on the defensive press rather than look to create their own chances.\n",
      " - Support – The “standard” role in playing as a Pressing Forward as the player will be riskier in trying to bring players into the game with more divisive passes and runs.\n",
      " - Attack – Not only will they try and perform the defensive press, but this player will also play as more of an advanced forward – meaning they will try and score rather than pass or bring in other players into the attack.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: False Nine\n",
      "Definition: A striker or center forward who drops deep into midfield. They do this to drag opposition defenders out of position, exploit space and create lanes for other attacking players.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Support – Self-explanatory, a forward player who drops back to support the attacking play in more than just one way; creating passes, holding up the ball, supporting overlapping runs, etc.\n",

      "Definition: The Goalkeeper role is having your keeper’s main focus on making saves from shots and collecting crosses. Essentially your keeper is the last line of defense and is the “traditional” keeper. Despite being traditional, depending on their attributes they can still play key passes and have excellent distribution.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Sweeper Keeper\n",
      "Definition: This Goalkeeping role is a mixture between being a standard keeper and a Libero in essence. They will clean up balls from out wide or come out far; potentially even outside their box to play as an extra player or to initiate passes and start counter-attacks with direct through balls. A sweeper keeper does not necessarily mean a brilliant distributor – it means that they can come out quickly and clean up balls which then puts them in an advantageous position to restart play, including long clearances.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Duty: Defend\n",
      "   Description: The keeper will play a lot more cautiously but still try to start attacking or counter-attacking plays. They do not venture too far out of their box when in possession.\n",
      " - Duty: Support\n",
      "   Description: The keeper will stray just outside their penalty box and look to be more influential in starting plays or counter-attacking measures.\n",
      " - Duty: Attack\n",
      "   Description: A very “brave” keeper who will travel far outside their area and be heavily involved with the ball at their feet.\n",

      "Role: Wide Centre-Back !NEW in FM22!\n",
      "Definition: The main job of this role is to stop the opposing attackers from playing and to clear the ball from danger when required. However, unlike standard central defenders - the Wide Centre-Back is encouraged to stay wide in position and support the midfield more like a full back.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Duty: Defend - The player is more like a traditional centre-back in a back five. They will provide support in wide areas at times, but from deep. Less likely to overlap or underlap and more likely to provide a diagonal backwards passing option.\n",
      "   Description: \n",
      " - Duty: Support - In the supportive role, the wide centre-back is willing to make overlapping and underlapping runs to create 2 vs 1 situations. In this essence, they play more of a “fullback” role in supporting the midfield.\n",
      "   Description: \n",
      " - Duty: Attack - With an attack duty, the player is willing to make regular overlapping and underlapping runs to create 2 vs 1 situations, and also has a higher tendency to dribble with the ball.\n",

      "   Description: The defender will be more of a “traditional” defender with this role. They will be with their defensive partner(s) in working to break up attacks, preventing the ball from going into the box and marking opposition as a part of your tactic.\n",
      " - Duty: Stopper\n",
      "   Description: The stopper is the defender who will step up a bit more and close down players, marking earlier in the defensive plays.\n",
      " - Duty: Cover\n",
      "   Description: This role will make your defender play more as a sweeper, they will drop back a bit further then your defensive partner(s) and sweep up balls and mark overlapping players (has to be made specific with tactics).\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Libero\n",
      "Definition: The libero literally means “to sweep”. They will stay behind the defensive line, looking to sweep up through balls, pick up extra forward players and make goal saving plays. This role has seen goalkeepers take this role as they play out more from the box. One brilliant positive of this role is the fact that this player allows an extra individual to be further back for taking care of defensive errors and taking possession of bad or loose balls.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Duty: Support\n",
      "   Description: With the Support duty, the libero will step into a midfield role when your team is in possession and look to start attacking play. Essentially a deep lying playmaker.\n",
      " - Duty: Attack\n",
      "   Description: With the Attack duty on, the libero almost has complete free reign as they will venture forward to provide a goal scoring threat either in the box but mostly from distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Ball Playing Defender\n",
      "Definition: This is the more common role seen in today’s football with defenders having to play out of the back and be excellent in passing. They will still have the main duty of being a defender and stop opposition attacks, but they are encouraged to play long balls or start moving forward with splitting balls and passes. This is really key for counter attacks.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Duty: Defend\n",
      "   Description: The defender will not venture forward with this role, they will look to still perform defensive duties and play passes out from the back but their position will be in line with the defensive line or their partner.\n",
      " - Duty: Stopper\n",
      "   Description: Similar to the normal Central Defender role, they will close down players before getting into the box. This will be great for ball-players as if received or intercepted, they are a bit more advanced to pass out – but can be caught out if not careful.\n",
      " - Duty: Cover\n",
      "   Description: This role is where the defender will drop deeper and still play balls but more across the back, to the wings or from behind the defensive line.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: No-Nonsense Centre Back\n",
      "Definition: The “old-school” role of a defender with only one thing in mind – clear it and stop attacks. The goal of the defender with this duty is to win the ball and get it cleared up the field and take no risks in doing so. Sometimes these clearances involve sending it to the stands rather than look for a pass, even if at moderate risk.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Duty: Defend\n",
      "   Description: The same role as the Central Defender, staying in line with their defensive partner and break up attacks.\n",

      "Definition: The main duties of this midfielder is to protect the defensive line when not in possession and support the midfield and advance players when in possession. They also have the key role of holding onto the ball and dictating the tempo or play to allow the defense and attack to reorganize themselves or get in position.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Duty: Defend\n",
      "   Description: They will stay more defensive, similar to being an extra central defender but stay ahead of the defensive line and look to recycle possession efficiently.\n",
      " - Duty: Support\n",
      "   Description: With this role, the defensive midfielder will be more in line with the midfield, supporting attacking moves but staying a touch further back – almost in a screening or safety role to be on guard of a counterattack.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Deep Lying Playmaker\n",
      "Definition: Operates in the spaces between the defense and midfield. They aim to start attacking plays by passing out to players or spaces further up the pitch. They are more creative but must also fulfill their defensive duties. Essentially a creative passer from deep.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Duty: Defend\n",
      "   Description: This duty will make the player focus more on the defensive side of the game and support attacks but mostly just from passes. Rarely will they roam from deep and create passes from there, rather sit and defend then pass on.\n",
      " - Duty: Support\n",
      "   Description: Fulfilling their defensive duty but will bring the ball out of the defense to open more opportunities to pass or create an opportunity. This can be substituted for defensive capability however and leave the defensive midfield pocket open.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Ball Winning Midfielder\n",
      "Definition: The ball winning midfielder has the main role of closing-down the opposition and winning the ball back.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Duty: Defend\n",
      "   Description: With this role, the player will look to win the ball back in front of the defensive line and quickly pass it on to another player.\n",

      "\n",
      "Role: Anchor Man\n",
      "Definition: The main duty of this player is to sit between the defense and midfield. Their main job is to win the ball, intercept moves, runs and if recouping the ball – pass it on to a more creative player. This player is more stagnant in positioning, they do not venture too far forward nor do they drop back as a Libero or as an extra Centre Back – therefore they do not close down opposition frequently who are too far forward.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Duty: Defend\n",
      "   Description: There is just one role for this position, and it makes sense considering their role. They are best suited in a structured system who have the straight-forward task of anchoring the defense, not being too creative nor dribble – essentially as risk free as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Half Back\n",
      "Definition: A mixture of a role which can be a bit confusing. The half-back at times will play as an extra center back to help recycle possession or be an extra passing option to continue moving the ball. They also play the role of being a defensive midfielder by supporting just above the defensive line and offer protection when out of possession.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Duty: Defend\n",
      "   Description: Again another duty with just a defensive role as they don’t adventure forward and are on the pitch to aid the defensive first and foremost.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Regista\n",
      "Definition: Like a Deep Lying Playmaker but have way more freedom. Overall an aggressive, fast-paced midfielder who will look to press high, dictate the play from deep positions and offer creative outlets or transitional plays. What’s key is the unpredictability as they are given free rein on the pitch positionally – however that can also backfire if not set up properly in your tactic.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Duty: Support\n",
      "   Description: A perfect description of the Regista, an aggressive supporter from the deep midfield position. Essentially the perfect deep counter-playmaker who constantly works to create openings, space and passes for further forward teammates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Roaming Playmaker\n",
      "Definition: This player will look to pick up the ball from a deep position and work it forward with runs, passing and creativity. They venture forward to outside the opposition penalty area as they look to create or shoot.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Duty: Support\n",
      "   Description: Only one real role and that is the duty of a Roaming Playmaker. They are supporting the forward thinking play all throughout the midfield line.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Segundo Volante\n",
      "Definition: A direct translation for Segundo Volante is “Second Steering Wheel”. This player’s role is mainly a defensive role and a late support when going forward. They often run with the ball, arrive in an area with a late run and are the “second steering wheel” in supporting the attacking play. Rather than being the “main” player, they are best partnered with an alternate more key or pivotal player such as an Anchor Man or Ball Winning Midfielder.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Duty: Support\n",
      "   Description: The supportive role will make this player support the attack but picking and choosing the opportunities to arrive late in threatening areas. That success is based off their attributes.\n",
      " - Duty: Attack\n",
      "   Description: They are regularly arriving late in the penalty area or a real threat from distance as they attempt more shots on goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Central Midfielder\n",
      "Definition: The central midfielder is the link player and a hard worker. Rather than being more technically adept like a box-to-box midfielder, the central midfielder will perform various roles based on instruction, their abilities, and the needs of the team.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Duty: Defend\n",
      "   Description: This role will make the player focus more on the defensive midfield actions; sitting deep, tracking midfield runners and passing lanes and controlling the temp and pace of your team.\n",
      " - Duty: Support\n",
      "   Description: A more balanced role between moving forward with the attack and supporting the defense when necessary. Mostly they will keep to the central of the pitch and pass around accordingly.\n",
      " - Duty: Attack\n",
      "   Description: This role will oblige your player to move forward into the final third and be a support for the forward players.\n",
      " - Duty: Automatic\n",
      "   Description: The midfielder will swap between the above three roles depending upon your team mentality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Box-to-Box Midfielder\n",
      "Definition: The “workhorse” of the midfield. Their attributes allow these players to contribute on all avenues of the pitch; attacking means their surging late into the box, have killer passes and provide a threat from distance. In defense it means protecting the back line and disturbing opposition midfield-to-forward play.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Duty: Support\n",
      "   Description: There is only one role and that is the supportive role, which perfectly describes this player. The box-to-box midfielder is the support player in a squad. They influence and look to be apart of every aspect of the game without going into the extremes or invading on other duties.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Advanced Playmaker\n",
      "Definition: This player will look to find space in-between the opposition’s midfield and defense. Their main role is be available for their teammates, whether that is to pass to, run into an open space or when out of possession find the pass or run to get onto the attack immediately.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Duty: Support\n",
      "   Description: In the supporting role, the advanced playmaker will look to stay in between the two lines of the opposition and be the main support.\n",
      " - Duty: Attack\n",
      "   Description: This role gives the advanced playmaker the license to have a delayed or secondary run at the opposition which is to get the ball into the final third quickly and create an opportunity to pass the ball.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Mezzala\n",
      "Definition: The direct translation is “wing half or half wing(er)”. So, this player is a central player that likes to drift wide but not too far wide as they are only a “half wing” – meaning they operate in the half-spaces. Simplistically in spaces from the center to the wing but not permanently on either extremity. They are positioned higher up in the midfield line and generally do not have as much defensive responsibility.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Duty: Support\n",
      "   Description: The supportive role sees them work between being a midfield and the “traditional work” along with their role and their contribution further up the pitch.\n",
      " - Duty: Attack\n",
      "   Description: This player generally leaves the midfield role and focuses more on moving slightly further up the pitch and working those half-spaces to contribute in the final third.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Carrilero\n",
      "Definition: A direct translation is “railway man” or “con man” which is quite fitting to the football description of this duty being defined as a midfielder who is a “shuttler”. The job of this individual is to cover the lateral areas of the pitch and link the defense with the midfield. It is a deceptive role as they are a support piece of the midfield and link the lines of the midfield – hence the term “shuttler”.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Full Back\n",
      "Definition: The difference between the Full Back and the Wing Back is that the Full Back remains primarily a defensive player but will move forward when the team needs extra width. They are also more of a supportive role when going forward and not necessarily always in attack. Essentially defense is the priority then they will look forward while the Wing Back is opposite.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Duty: Defend\n",
      "   Description: They will stay back with the defensive line; in possession they will play simple passes and not take much risk.\n",

      " - Duty: Attack\n",
      "   Description: The Full Back will start to diminish their defensive responsibilities and focus more in overlapping (or underlapping if tactics permit) the midfield and will look to provide crosses immediately into the box or killer balls across or in front of the opposition penalty area.\n",

      "   Description: This role will set your Full Back to swap between the three above roles based on the team mentality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Wing Back\n",
      "Definition: The Wing Back fulfills both the attacking duties of a winger and the defensive duties of a full back. They are seen up and down the wide positions on the pitch, looking to put in attacking play up the pitch, support the midfield and fall back into defense. Ones who play in this Wing Back role do not usually put defensive responsibilities first nor are actually too solid in defense at times.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Duty: Defend\n",
      "   Description: Majority they will stay further back, a bit deeper but will still find space and look to support with passes and crossing in attack.\n",
      " - Duty: Support\n",
      "   Description: They will support attacking movement more with balls in and out of midfield, diagonal crosses and long through balls when needed.\n",
      " - Duty: Attack\n",
      "   Description: This role is the role where you see the Wing Back overlap with other attacking players and move in line with the attack to provide wide support.\n",
      " - Duty: Automatic\n",
      "   Description: Depending upon your team mentality, the roles will switch from the above three.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: No-Nonsense Full Back\n",
      "Definition: Similar to the Non-Nonsense Center Back – focusing predominantly on the defensive duties and rarely bombs forward in supportive or attacking play. Think of a “flat back line” for case in point. These players will be more disciplined and tactically adapt to whatever your responsibilities are for them defensively - minimizing offensive roles and attributes.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Complete Wing Back\n",
      "Definition: The complete wing back is competent in defensive but is essentially the attacking full-back. They will move forward to attack whenever possible and push into the opposition’s defensive third naturally.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Duty: Support - Mostly be a supportive role and be smarter in play with their desire to move forward while keeping an eye on their defensive responsibilities.\n",
      "   Description: \n",
      " - Duty: Attack\n",
      "   Description: Abandon more their role to defend and stay just a bit further back in the final third in compensation for impacting the attacking play in a game.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Inverted Wing Back\n",
      "Definition: An Inverted Wing Back will line up as a standard wide defender, but they will move in field when in possession rather than stick wide to either create space or be an extra passing option. If teammates are not ahead of this player, they will push forward more and be supportive in the middle of the pitch.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Duty: Defend\n",

      " - Duty: Attack\n",
      "   Description: Cut in and move forward, supporting the attacking play either by cutting in or drifting out wide but mostly found in a more central area when up the pitch.\n",

      "   Description: Will swap between the above three depending upon your team mentality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Wide Midfielder\n",
      "Definition: The stereotypical player in a standard 4-4-2 – performing both the defensive and attacking duties out wide. They are supportive players who perform work for all three avenues of the pitch: defense, midfield and attack.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Duty: Defend\n",
      "   Description: This role instructs the player to sit back more as a cover for the defense and launch crosses from deep.\n",
      " - Duty: Support\n",
      "   Description: They will support the midfield play more, be more adventurous with through or diagonal passes and get balls into the box when appropriate. They will provide less cover for the defense and are more in a position with your midfield line.\n",
      " - Duty: Attack\n",
      "   Description: Moving up more and play quick crosses while they are in the final third of the pitch.\n",
      " - Duty: Automatic\n",

      "\n",
      "Role: Winger\n",
      "Definition: Little to say about this role – simplistically its to stick wide towards the sideline, bomb forward either with the ball or beat the opposition and attack the byline.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Duty: Support\n",
      "   Description: The supportive wall sets up the winger to cross early or launch long and through balls forward first and run to the byline to cross into the box.\n",
      " - Duty: Attack\n",
      "   Description: The attack duty will mean to attack the opposition defense specifically and then cross or even shoot if found in a position to do so. This role is more disruption then being a creative outlet via crossing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Defensive Winger\n",
      "Definition: The duty of a Defensive Winger is to press opposition wide players, winning the ball up high the pitch and holding up play if necessary. In attacking play they can either drive to the byline or look to cut in slightly and play passes inwards or long diagonal/through balls.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Duty: Defend\n",
      "   Description: The primary play with the defending role is to be a screen and insurance for the defensive players behind this player. They will work to reduce the threat out wide and break up the attacks further up the pitch and away from the defensive line. Keep in mind that they are not a defensive anchor however unless their attributes, personality, traits, your tactics and more guide them in that direction.\n",
      " - Duty: Support\n",
      "   Description: Less defensive responsibility and more the traditional wide player who will look to cross the ball early, run past the opposition or pass inwards to the midfield to recycle possession or progress forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Wide Playmaker\n",
      "Definition: The wide playmaker is a dual role. In possession, the player will be a source of creativity by drifting inside or out wide to find space and therefore a chance. Defensively (which is not common) their role is to provide cover for the defensive wide players such as the full back’s – but they will not be astute in defensive capabilities, rather being an “extra body” or covering space in the defensive line.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Duty: Support\n",
      "   Description: When the team is in possession, they will drift into a central midfield position or be just in line with the midfield and act as a creator on the ball.\n",
      " - Duty: Attack\n",
      "   Description: Being more advanced, they will sit in pockets of space between the midfield and attacking line in forward play. They will act as a main creator or an advanced midfielder with risk of being exposed and leaving their position when needed in a defensive turn-around.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Inverted Winger\n",
      "Definition: Often confused with an Inside Forward, the Inverted Winger has the goal of creating and opening space for onrushing wide players such as the full backs. Like the Inside Forward they will look to create and focus on their stronger foot which is opposite to the side of the pitch they are positioned on. Inverted Wingers tend to be more in between opposition lines of defense and midfield, focusing more on build up play rather than being a finishing force such as an Inside Forward.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Duty: Support\n",
      "   Description: Supportive role means the wingers will cut into the middle which will open up space outside. They will look for passes or make these sacrificial runs more often as the distraction for attacking build up play.\n",
      " - Duty: Attack\n",
      "   Description: They runs in the attacking role will be more directed at the opposition defense, dragging along extra defensive players to make a killer pass, cross or potential shot while still running into the opposition final third.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Inside Forward\n",
      "Definition: More of a common sight in the modern game, the inside forward’s goal is to run from out wide towards the center of the opposition’s defense and penalty box. The reason for this is to make use of the player’s strongest foot which is the opposite of the side of the pitch he plays on. This movement allows for your teammates to run into space and commit to overlaps if instructed appropriately.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Duty: Support\n",
      "   Description: Majority of the time they will cut in diagonally across behind the opposition defense or at them. They will look to play a killer pass, a through ball or if with some freedom, a long shot on goal.\n",
      " - Duty: Attack\n",
      "   Description: They will run at the defense as more of the “spearhead” in the attacking phase. They will look to find passes, crosses, and shots when deep in opposition territory or even find themselves in the box as an extra forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Wide Target Man\n",
      "Definition: Similar to being an “upfront” target man, they will be the target for transitional play, clearances and long balls from the back, but their location is that out wide rather than in middle pockets. The main reason for doing this is to exploit a weaker opposition wide player or find pockets of space in an opposition tactic. All other portions of the role are the same to that of a Target Man.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Duty: Support\n",
      "   Description: The support duty instructs this player to be more upbuilding in attacking play – such as one touch play from headers or long balls to on rushing players, looking for passing lanes and opportunities towards the central players as they cause a nuisance out wide.\n",
      " - Duty: Attack\n",
      "   Description: Similar to the above but they will make their presence more known by forcing the opposition wide player(s) back with their attacking forward movement or overlapping/underlapping runs into the box once laying off the ball to a central player (your tactics permitting of course).\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Raumdeuter\n",
      "Definition: The Raumdeuter literally means “Space Investigator”. This means that the role of this player is to find pockets of space to operate in – whether out wide or in the middle of the field of play. They use this role to be an extra option in forward play and hold onto possession in the final third – then look for opportunities and little creative “moments” to execute a lethal pass or shot.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Duty: Attack\n",
      "   Description: Self explanatory as these players do not contribute to supportive or defensive play either on or off the ball. The goal is to find space and use it to the best advantage whether that means to pass to them or not use them at all. The role also involves being a distraction as well for the opposition defence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Attacking Midfielder\n",
      "Definition: Plays just in front of the central midfield role, therefore they are not found in deeper positions. They can either play just in front of the opposition’s midfield or just behind, they use their technical and mental abilities to create chances and screw with opposition defenders.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Duty: Support\n",
      "   Description: Rather then trying to press forward in attacking play and get into the opposition box, they will sit back in pockets of space to link play or offer a long-distance attacking threat.\n",
      " - Duty: Attack\n",
      "   Description: Not only will they create chances but be an extra presence in the box to finish or play that “final pass” in an attacking phase.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Trequartista\n",
      "Definition: Trequartista literally translates to “Three Quarters”. That is where they will be found as these players are found between the furthest forward attacker and the midfield. They would have the combination role of not only finishing ability but creativity and the vision of a playmaker. They do almost no defensive play and spend their time off the ball finding and drifting into open space so that way when the ball is retained, a pass can pinpoint them and start the attacking play.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Duty: AMC Attack\n",
      "   Description: The attacking role best suits the Trequartista as it defines their role. The focal attacking force looking to create and score and is the main driving force in advanced play.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Enganche\n",
      "Definition: Enganche directly translated means “Hitch”. That is exactly what this player does, similar to that of a Trequartista, they are the main link and prime creator in joining the midfield and attack. However, they do not move into large areas of space – similar to that of a hitch or a link, it is a key focal point which does not move around much in terms of space – it does one job and that is to link play and become a pivot to teammates around them.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Duty: Support\n",
      "   Description: They are a supportive player in terms of attack, not necessarily supportive in defensive measures such as pressing or dropping deep. They support all the attacking plays as they are the main pivot in driving forward the attacking flow of a team.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Shadow Striker\n",
      "Definition: Best suited with a partner upfront, the Shadow Striker is a goal-scorer. They look to find themselves in goal scoring positions outside that of their partner striker and close down the opposition when out of possession.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Duty: Attack\n",
      "   Description: Attacking is the only real role of the Shadow Striker, well they do press the opposition – that is only from the front and they do not drop back as in other roles to support the play. They create on and from the front line.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Deep Lying Forward\n",
      "Definition: Often confused with a pressing forward or false nine – the main idea is to be the link from the midfield or creative advanced midfield play to the attacking line. That means either dropping in space to create and pass, rotate and recycle possession or be the dribbling force to create space when going forward. Idealistically this role is best suited with another striker in your tactic as a partner.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Duty: Support\n",
      "   Description: The majority of this role will bring your player to focus on creating opportunities for teammates and aim to bring them into attacking play.\n",
      " - Duty: Attack\n",
      "   Description: This focus is not only to create but also bring themselves into good positions to finish attacking plays even when on the ball.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Advanced Forward\n",
      "Definition: This player has the role of being the main man or “focal point” of attacking moves – that means both creating and scoring. This individual will also chase down balls from the midfield, look to gain possession back (nowhere near as much as a pressing forward), and create if found in the correct position to do so.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Duty: Attack\n",
      "   Description: The main idea is to attack and be the focal point, therefore there will be no real “supportive” or “defensive” roles for this duty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Target Man\n",
      "Definition: They physical “big-man” up front who challenges the opponent’s defense and is a “nuisance” for defenders. Ideally the play is brought to them to open up more attacking play.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Duty: Support\n",
      "   Description: The supportive target man will look to win the ball when launched up to them and play passes which will bring other attacking players into the transition.\n",
      " - Duty: Attack\n",
      "   Description: The attacking target man will look to make plays to open space for teammates to run into. They also will look to find space for themselves and use their physicality to create their own opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Poacher\n",
      "Definition: The main goal is to break past the defensive line and score goals. Build up play is not seen from this player as the creative build up is to end with them scoring. They will make runs and plays where their “instincts” will create opportunities both inside and around the box.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Duty: Attack\n",
      "   Description: Straight forward attacking player or the “striker”. The goal (excuse the pain) is to get the ball in the back of the net and they have that “knack” or “instinct” for finding goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Complete Forward\n",
      "Definition: “The all-round forward”, they can shoot, hold up the ball, have that ability to be in the right place at the right time AND can pass the ball. This role is only suited to forwards who are technically adept to perform all those duties – not necessarily high rating attributes – but consistent in majority of their technical attributes.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Duty: Support\n",
      "   Description: This role will make the player focus a bit more on creative play or being the forward catalyst in creating or starting the attack.\n",
      " - Duty: Attack\n",
      "   Description: This role makes the complete forward lead the line in attacking play, not only creating opportunities for others but mostly themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: Pressing Forward\n",
      "Definition: “First defense is your attack” that is the role of the Pressing Forward. The main duty is to pressure the opposition players who have possession, press them down and make sure the opposition defense does not have too much time on the ball.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Duty: Defend\n",
      "   Description: With this role, the player will look to bring other players into the game first and focus more on the defensive press rather than look to create their own chances.\n",
      " - Duty: Support\n",
      "   Description: The “standard” role in playing as a Pressing Forward as the player will be riskier in trying to bring players into the game with more divisive passes and runs.\n",
      " - Duty: Attack\n",
      "   Description: Not only will they try and perform the defensive press, but this player will also play as more of an advanced forward – meaning they will try and score rather than pass or bring in other players into the attack.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role: False Nine\n",
      "Definition: A striker or center forward who drops deep into midfield. They do this to drag opposition defenders out of position, exploit space and create lanes for other attacking players.\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      " - Duty: Support\n",
      "   Description: Self-explanatory, a forward player who drops back to support the attacking play in more than just one way; creating passes, holding up the ball, supporting overlapping runs, etc.\n",
